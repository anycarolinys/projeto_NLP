1,1,Harakiri,1962,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★½ ,4.5," Firstly, I must apologise for holding off on this for so long. This is remarkable. It’s a film that raises a lot of issues about whether fervent loyalty to the code of honour is more valuable than humanity. And how that is unjustifiable. The execution is masterful, and the pay-off is even better. The resolution is entirely cathartic. It’s also incredibly well-choreographed, touching, and surprisingly exciting. I do think that I will need another watch in order to fully digest everything, though. ***",0.0,0.717,0.283,0.9781
2,2,Harakiri,1962,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★★ ,5.0," God damn what an impeccable film. Not dated in the least, if you tried to tell this same story now, 60 years later, this would still be the best way to tell it, shot for shot, line for line.I sometimes get intimidated by the fact that there is so much great film, both past and present, that I could never find time to see it all. Japan alone has way too many incredible filmmakers with extensive filmographies I’ve barely scraped the surface of. I don’t know what was in the water over there throughout the 20th century, but it must’ve been good. ***",0.048,0.855,0.097,0.7498

4,4,Harakiri,1962,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★★ ,5.0," Immediately pulls you in with its captivating simultaneous story-telling, which rings of mystery and intrigue as the plot thickens and builds. There’s so much beauty in intimate and heartbreaking dialogue, and this films display of powerful rhetoric, equally as thoughtful as it can be emotionally jarring, is absolute class. Everything builds as an eerie and heart-pounding score adds layers of uncertainty to an already nervous experience. This all builds to our final few sequences which mesmerized me and solidified Harakiri as not only the greatest samurai film ever made, but one of the best films ever made. ***",0.083,0.807,0.109,0.7055

One man willing to sacrifice his life for his own personal cause; Hanshirō dedicated everything to a morality that ruthlessly betrayed him, and in setting out to take his revenge, he reveals the moral hypocrisies of Bushidō, which prove to be more damning to his antagonists than any amount of malefic bloodshed he could inflict.But blood will be spilled.

Kobayashi's Harakiri — the Letterbox top 250 number three — is a film I inexplicably forgot about having seen twice already, which I'm incredibly thankful for, considering whatever unfathomable reason made it not stick with me before certainly didn't rear its ugly head again. First time giving a samurai film such a positive score, chiefly for finely balancing familiar genre ideas with excellent storytelling, and for being both singularly poignant storywise, and singularly critical of the samurai honour culture, when compared to geo-historical contemporaries. ***",0.02,0.741,0.239,0.9735

Unbearable extreme close-ups of its witnesses and beautiful roaming camera moves (ensuring we see even what the characters maybe miss) that in tandem form a series of vivid, unsparing, and surreal vignettes around the psychological experience of unimaginably barbaric horror being made tangible.

This type of cinema requires the upmost patience, and that I shall try to muster.

842,842,Andrei Rublev,1966,Andrei Tarkovsky, ★★★★★ ,5.0," Tarkovsky's expanses here are breathtaking in their cold beauty and atmospheric horror, and his massacre sequence is wildly mounted. The terror of nature and the man-made world force confrontation with superficial, cloistered faith, which subsequently reshaped and, ultimately, reaffirmed by confrontation. In an odd way it's a reminder that true faith was accelerating the contradictions well before Karl Marx suggested it as a bedrock of communism.

Some of the best cinematography I’ve seen, a deeply philosophical and emotional script coupled with amazing performances truly makes this a transformative film. I think sometimes the 3 hour run time really messes with the film a little bit though, and I wish the basic plot was a little easier to follow (lots of characters and easy to miss exposition), but all in all an amazing film.9.3 / 10 ***",0.057,0.72,0.223,0.9341

Filled to the brim with a lot of truths and a lot of conflict about religion, history and art. An ambitious story that's clearly very personal to Tarkovsky. And once again, it's brought to life spectacularly. Swooping wide shots, every angle beautifully composed, getting into the nitty and gritty of all the conflicts that Rublev lived through. A thoroughly beautiful production.Unfortunately, it just didn't work that well for me. I really wanted it to, but it didn't. A wonderful production nonetheless. ***",0.085,0.795,0.121,0.4103

That being said, the drama is heartbreaking and melancholic, but still, a bit too simple for my taste, it tends to be a bit theatrical at times. Like I said before, visually strong, but not consistent. The soundtrack is also a big let down for me. Anyway, it might sound negative, it doesn’t matter much.

Pontecorvo's sharp camera placement here really highlighted the beauty of algerian architecture. This is a film filled with vigour, power, ambition, made to document, inspire and overwhelm.

The Berlin townspeople form a vigilante party to hunt him down, proving more staunch than police. The film has a notable showdown in a basement where the suspect is trapped and gazed at by vengeful, dark faces. Directed by Fritz Lang (“Metropolis”); his use of silhouettes and low contrast lighting, from front to back, is peak expressionism. ***",0.188,0.737,0.075,-0.9186

Robert Bresson's A Man Escaped focuses more on the different valleys and peaks of reaching an end goal rather than the consequences of such tribulations. It's a film comprised of footsteps, whispers, minor errors, minor victories, and the celebratory rush of triumph over hardship. While most films ""fade to black"" to signify an end or a particular moment of importance, the key to A Man Escaped is its usage of the fade as an assured step into danger and the reluctant quest for hope.

Your complaint is that the title sells away the ending, right? Bresson has never cared about the outcomes; instead, his humanity testaments focus on the struggle of life itself given a set of circumstances.

The finding of a spoon feels grandiose in the span of this runtime, and each mini triumph gives us that much more hope. The sound design is also very incredible, footsteps and keys running along stairs are established early on to keep viewers listening, making sure Fontaine isn't ever in danger. If there was a film that best captures the essence of human spirit, this would be the one. Fantastic. ***",0.027,0.727,0.246,0.9744
1854,1854,A Man Escaped,1956,Robert Bresson, ★★★★½ ,4.5," Scavenger Hunt #52A Man Escaped is one of the most tensest films I’ve seen even though the title tells you what happens. This is mainly down to the phenomenal lead performance that gets you behind the character from the start. The slow pace also builds up the tension perfectly until the edge of the seat climax.I wasn’t sure what to expect from this film but now I can’t wait to see more from Robert Bresson.

1856,1856,A Man Escaped,1956,Robert Bresson, ★★★★ ,4.0," A Man Escaped is a minimalistic look at the harsh nature of imprisonment. It’s a meticulously crafted film that ensures each and every action carried out by the protagonist fully immerses us in his monotonous daily routine. Because of that, there are moments that require immense patience from the viewer, but the many carefully calculated moments of suspense (specifically those in the third act) make the whole journey worth it.

Even though Kalatozov's vision is political, he focuses intently on his human subjects. I'm amazed that a movie made by the bloody Soviet Union ten years after the death of Stalin can grasp of how to make a film with a political agenda while still creating moments between people that feel genuine.

Filled with stunning action, great one liners and a refreshing blend of tones. The film manages to be funny, melancholic and action packed all at once. There’s hardly ever a dull moment and the film flies by. There’s so much sub text to the film, specifically the opening scene and the final scene can be interpreted in so many ways (no spoilers here but definitely look into it if you can, it’s extremely interesting.) Yojimbo is a film fan must !

2401,2401,Still Walking,2008,Hirokazu Kore-eda, ★★★★½ ,4.5," In Still Walking, people don't change; their familial relationships won't change, or at least in any dramatic, fundamental sense. Avoidance always overcomes confrontation. As for communication, whether it's interpreted through coded words or physical action, silence will more than likely prevail. No closure is offered; resentments are left unvented, problems remain unsolved, but they are collectively acknowledged, and even understood by these characters. Kore-eda is so good at conveying affection through the minutiae of delicate gestures, expressions, and awkward interactions that he makes me long for a day to go back to my sweet home. I'm always like that. I'm always a little late. ***",0.089,0.76,0.151,0.9093

It is what nostalgia and solace would look like. It is silent, sincere, honest and nuanced. Still Walking proves that drama doesn’t always have to be a grief-stricken heavy scene to leave a lasting detrimental effect. Having experienced personal loss isn’t a requirement for you to relate to this realistic family portrait that gently makes you forget you are watching a movie, but simply a bystander looking in on a family dealing with loss.Sinegang weekly pick #2 by Hannah ***",0.041,0.844,0.115,0.6908

It’s unusual circular structure is bold for its time and bolder still for someone as adamantly formal as Lean. While very much a melodrama, it’s defining cathartic moment is echoed in countless romantic comedies to great effect.

Coupled with flat performances and a manipulative hollowness that is reflected in both characters and story, I wasn't able to connect with this at all. It looks great, with cinematography that makes the most of the film's spartan iconography. It's also contextually remarkable in spite of itself. I'd even say there's a great short in this, buried under the film's 10,000 instances of people looking for and eating fruit.

Non-stop action, futuristic violence intertwined with parent issues, create an astoundingly thrilling and absorbingly enthralling actuality, in which the viewers will almost certainly get gulped into. Even when not a fan of action, Judgment Day will impress you with how advanced, and substantially entertaining it is. It imagines things you wouldn't even be likely to dream and gets these sequences onscreen with a flawlessness that is outstanding.EDIT: unfortunately Letterboxd temporary logged me out, and unfollowed everyone I used to follow, I will be refollowing as many people as I can. ***",0.065,0.721,0.214,0.9547

However, perhaps most of all, it is timeless. Director Toshio Matsumoto captures 1960s Japan with such specificity and intention, guiding us beyond whatever we usually see on a surface level. Many films explore identity; few do so as thoughtfully and impressively as this. And with society at large becoming increasingly polarized, it will only grow to be more relevant than it already is. ***",0.031,0.895,0.074,0.539

Whether man travels to space, to the Zone, or even just across the span of his own time, he lugs his own faulty desires with him. And, just as depicted with trademark Tarkovsky hypnotic mastery in “Solaris,” this is both selfish, and the most deeply human of acts - worthy in its failure of all the love the universe can muster. ***",0.109,0.83,0.06,-0.5879

Following arguably his most revered work which also criticised the ruthless desire for sensation, Sunset Boulevard, Wilder moves away from the destructive force that is Hollywood and ventures into journalistic corruption, set in pallid Albuquerque.

This is a war movie that does not focus on gun fights, explosions or violence of war per se, but the futility of it and the arrogance inherent in manmade destruction. Part adventure, part humane allegory, the film is also a deeply ironic portrayal of stubbornness and persistence. Performances are all perfect, photography is legendary, and the entire production is just suffused in an epic scale that only Lean that deliver.

Secrets & Lies is the sort of film that Hollywood not only doesn't make but can't; it's an industry that just isn't equipped to explore ordinary people in a believable way. Leigh's dismissal of the sentiment that a major American studio would have brought only bolsters the success of his film's emotional impact, and if everything feels a bit too neat and tidy at the end, it's a small price to pay for the way it makes you feel. Plus, it's really the getting there that counts: Blethyn, Spall and Jean-Baptiste are phenomenal.Previous review ***",0.033,0.864,0.103,0.8573

Bertolucci's is by far the greater achievement, simply because dramatic subtlety and verisimilitude render this particular subject far more chilling; it's hard to watch The Cremator and wonder whether something like the events depicted might genuinely have happened.

It's such a grandiose story to take on and yet Gance comes closer to capturing Napoleon's life than any film to come after. The camera work is just as ambitious. The movement of the camera is so fluid in capturing the action and the use of handheld shots is striking and adds a huge layer of depth to the atmosphere of certain scenes.

A fight for the right of individuality and to love who you please.

Aparajito will go on to eloquently dramatize similar oppositions: tradition versus invention; religion versus science; adolescence versus adulthood. All square off in the life of Apu, and indeed in his heart.More here. ***",0.016,0.984,0.0,-0.0516

It gets worse as it gets better, and heritage is a grim lifelong weight burning as the future glides closer. Apu needs a prayer, a break, a stroke of mercy. Yet it doesn’t come.
