1,1,1,Harakiri,1962,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★½ ,4.5," Firstly, I must apologise for holding off on this for so long. This is remarkable. It’s a film that raises a lot of issues about whether fervent loyalty to the code of honour is more valuable than humanity. And how that is unjustifiable. The execution is masterful, and the pay-off is even better. The resolution is entirely cathartic. It’s also incredibly well-choreographed, touching, and surprisingly exciting. I do think that I will need another watch in order to fully digest everything, though. ***",0.011628874,0.059549186,0.9288219

Not dated in the least, if you tried to tell this same story now, 60 years later, this would still be the best way to tell it, shot for shot, line for line.I sometimes get intimidated by the fact that there is so much great film, both past and present, that I could never find time to see it all. Japan alone has way too many incredible filmmakers with extensive filmographies I’ve barely scraped the surface of.

There’s so much beauty in intimate and heartbreaking dialogue, and this films display of powerful rhetoric, equally as thoughtful as it can be emotionally jarring, is absolute class. Everything builds as an eerie and heart-pounding score adds layers of uncertainty to an already nervous experience. This all builds to our final few sequences which mesmerized me and solidified Harakiri as not only the greatest samurai film ever made, but one of the best films ever made. ***",0.0032215575,0.038512915,0.9582656

Kobayashi's Harakiri — the Letterbox top 250 number three — is a film I inexplicably forgot about having seen twice already, which I'm incredibly thankful for, considering whatever unfathomable reason made it not stick with me before certainly didn't rear its ugly head again. First time giving a samurai film such a positive score, chiefly for finely balancing familiar genre ideas with excellent storytelling, and for being both singularly poignant storywise, and singularly critical of the samurai honour culture, when compared to geo-historical contemporaries. ***",0.033914026,0.22348042,0.7426055

Because after Billy Wilders huge success ""Some like it hot"" in 1959 he wanted to direct another comedy alongside Jack Lemmon and I honestly expected something like said one which is additionaly one of my favorite comedys.

Looking forward to some emotional payoff in the final film, because I haven't found too much in terms of personal connection just quite yet.

Oh, and also a pretty devastating subversion of the white man's burden narrative, in which a man hates his own people and tries to go native, but is always reminded he cannot, no matter his accomplishments. Another epic on the subject would have ended in a blaze of glory. This one stops in a pool of self-contempt. Almost makes one look forward to the release of Lawrence's death seen in the film's opening. ***",0.4308958,0.40571663,0.16338758

Post-intermission gets messier, necessarily so to an extent, but one does slouch in one's chair ever-so-slightly. ***",0.0139604425,0.09822005,0.8878195

Had not seen a Fellini since my first year of college, and this made me want to give him another spin—clearly an adroit classicist at heart as much as Antonioni was, but with a bouncy surface that indulges in order to reveal hidden layers of depth within the emotions. There's a clarity to the filmmaking that instead of simplifying moments gives them enormous depth and breathe. Perhaps the greatest film performance of all time. ***",0.0019785068,0.057292808,0.94072866

She has a strength in that humanity that is rarely explored through film, as film oftentimes shows battered people succumbing to battering back in a cathartic form of revenge but with a half-baked message of revenge's damage underneath it (that's a little unfair- there's some movies that do this fantastically).But Nights of Cabiria is about the strength of the unbreakable human spirit, all the way to the amazing final shot ***",0.068346344,0.43519074,0.496463

It really is an early blueprint of how to do psychological thrillers. It expertly blurs the line between what is deemed right and wrong making your own moral compass feel foggy. Lang really captured this city's collective anger and thirst to catch the killer, in turn making all the citizens a single character trying to take down one man who walks among them.

Peter Lorre is the child murderer who can’t help his compulsive thrill for overpowering his young prey. The Berlin townspeople form a vigilante party to hunt him down, proving more staunch than police. The film has a notable showdown in a basement where the suspect is trapped and gazed at by vengeful, dark faces. Directed by Fritz Lang (“Metropolis”); his use of silhouettes and low contrast lighting, from front to back, is peak expressionism. ***",0.49328417,0.44656095,0.060154874

Robert Bresson's A Man Escaped focuses more on the different valleys and peaks of reaching an end goal rather than the consequences of such tribulations. It's a film comprised of footsteps, whispers, minor errors, minor victories, and the celebratory rush of triumph over hardship. While most films ""fade to black"" to signify an end or a particular moment of importance, the key to A Man Escaped is its usage of the fade as an assured step into danger and the reluctant quest for hope. For Bresson, every movement and action is just the beginning. ***",0.0525392,0.6142563,0.33320448

Bresson's style of constantly moving from one relevant event to another and letting images speak while assigning a great importance to silences and facial expressions confirms the truth hidden in the phrase ""in simplicity lies complexity"". Your complaint is that the title sells away the ending, right? Bresson has never cared about the outcomes; instead, his humanity testaments focus on the struggle of life itself given a set of circumstances.

Bresson does so much with so little, placing the viewers in prison as well, feeling every small achievement Fontaine does. The finding of a spoon feels grandiose in the span of this runtime, and each mini triumph gives us that much more hope. The sound design is also very incredible, footsteps and keys running along stairs are established early on to keep viewers listening, making sure Fontaine isn't ever in danger.

Even though Kalatozov's vision is political, he focuses intently on his human subjects. I'm amazed that a movie made by the bloody Soviet Union ten years after the death of Stalin can grasp of how to make a film with a political agenda while still creating moments between people that feel genuine.

One need not be a great person to be a great personality; in fact, the more the personality, the less the person.Or maybe I just like movies about female sociopaths. ***",0.21750659,0.4097918,0.3727016

Notice, though, how many times after this shot we see a character pick something up and set it on a chair or a table: a cloth, a piece of paper, in one case a dropped coin purse.

Filled with stunning action, great one liners and a refreshing blend of tones. The film manages to be funny, melancholic and action packed all at once. There’s hardly ever a dull moment and the film flies by. There’s so much sub text to the film, specifically the opening scene and the final scene can be interpreted in so many ways (no spoilers here but definitely look into it if you can, it’s extremely interesting.) Yojimbo is a film fan must !

Non-stop action, futuristic violence intertwined with parent issues, create an astoundingly thrilling and absorbingly enthralling actuality, in which the viewers will almost certainly get gulped into. Even when not a fan of action, Judgment Day will impress you with how advanced, and substantially entertaining it is. It imagines things you wouldn't even be likely to dream and gets these sequences onscreen with a flawlessness that is outstanding.EDIT: unfortunately Letterboxd temporary logged me out, and unfollowed everyone I used to follow, I will be refollowing as many people as I can. ***",0.027495641,0.14413132,0.828373

Whether man travels to space, to the Zone, or even just across the span of his own time, he lugs his own faulty desires with him. And, just as depicted with trademark Tarkovsky hypnotic mastery in “Solaris,” this is both selfish, and the most deeply human of acts - worthy in its failure of all the love the universe can muster. ***",0.40182257,0.48754445,0.11063297

Violence here isn't like how other films do it, just the cause of something that cannot be controlled. Kiyoshi Kurosawa is a director that needs more recognition.

Secrets & Lies is the sort of film that Hollywood not only doesn't make but can't; it's an industry that just isn't equipped to explore ordinary people in a believable way. Leigh's dismissal of the sentiment that a major American studio would have brought only bolsters the success of his film's emotional impact, and if everything feels a bit too neat and tidy at the end, it's a small price to pay for the way it makes you feel. Plus, it's really the getting there that counts: Blethyn, Spall and Jean-Baptiste are phenomenal.Previous review ***",0.10176486,0.32189393,0.5763412

Bertolucci's is by far the greater achievement, simply because dramatic subtlety and verisimilitude render this particular subject far more chilling; it's hard to watch The Cremator and wonder whether something like the events depicted might genuinely have happened.

The main character is an insane sadist cremator. There are so many great scenes with him. My favorite is when he held up a cat and told it that after he cremates it won't recognize itself. It's as messed up as it is funny, and although it's funny it holds some strong commentary. It's amazing. Added to THE 60s ***",0.016928237,0.053255092,0.92981666

One man talking over images about whatever the hell he wants always makes for more cogitative exposition.Overall it works, the fisheye lens cinematography is always creepy especially when paired with a seedy character such as Kopfrkingl and the Nazi angle, while an angle I hadn’t been expecting, certainly helps to deliver on the “horror” aspect of this. ***",0.13732168,0.39731047,0.46536788

Perhaps they are an attempt to give life to victims, but it strikes me as revisionist at best and disrespectful at worst.
