The Elephant Man,1980,David Lynch, ★★★★½ ," ""My life is full, because I know that I am loved.”Such a beautiful and touching film, a true lesson about humanity. The direction from David Lynch is admirable and the choice to shoot the film in black and white was perfect, as it’s a depressing representation of a man’s suffering and how despicable people can be towards others. Anthony Hopkins was really great portraying ‘Dr. Frederick’ but John Hurt stole the show as ‘John Merrick’, perfectly capturing the pain and vulnerability of his character. ***",4.5,"{'neg': 0.167, 'neu': 0.66, 'pos': 0.172, 'compound': 0.1397}",0.1397,neu,pos

Some Like It Hot,1959,Billy Wilder, ★★★★ ," I know Some Like it Hot is considered “one of the final nails in the coffin of the Hays Code” for obvious reasons, but it’s actually kind of fun to rack up just how many other “rules” this film breaks concerning over twenty years of censorship. A five-minute make-out session with both figures in a reclining position. A throwaway line that includes the word “pregnant”. The bust of that Marilyn dress. It’s like the perfect meeting point between the old studio system era and the New Hollywood of the late 60s. ***",4.0,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.857, 'pos': 0.143, 'compound': 0.9332}",0.9332,pos,pos

Funeral Parade of Roses,1969,Toshio Matsumoto, ★★★★★ ," Funeral Parade of Roses is a lot of things – experimental, idiosyncratic, progressive, intersectional. However, perhaps most of all, it is timeless. Director Toshio Matsumoto captures 1960s Japan with such specificity and intention, guiding us beyond whatever we usually see on a surface level. Many films explore identity; few do so as thoughtfully and impressively as this. And with society at large becoming increasingly polarized, it will only grow to be more relevant than it already is. ***",5.0,"{'neg': 0.031, 'neu': 0.895, 'pos': 0.074, 'compound': 0.539}",0.539,pos,pos

Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans,1927,F. W. Murnau, ★★★½ ," ""Don't be afraid of me."" - man, Look, getting a pig drunk was funny back in 1927. The score is beautiful, the images are haunting, and it's pretty cool that this is one of the first ever films to use tracking shots. Sunrise is a lovely, and sometimes funny, story about romance and deceit and it kept my attention for the most part, which is not something I can say for all silent films. F.W. Murnau really understood how to craft a pretty shot and I'll always appreciate him for that.

There isn't really much else to say to be honest...It definitely is the masterpiece that its hyped up to be.It definitely is essential viewing.It definitely is one of the greatest films ever made.It definitely is one of my favourite films.It definitely is all that.It is everything.Kurosawa Ranked List ***",5.0,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.779, 'pos': 0.221, 'compound': 0.9712}",0.9712,pos,pos

A Man Escaped,1956,Robert Bresson, ★★★★★ ," As a realistic, breathtaking, influential and heart-pounding recount of a true POW story, it is a shining triumph. Bresson's style of constantly moving from one relevant event to another and letting images speak while assigning a great importance to silences and facial expressions confirms the truth hidden in the phrase ""in simplicity lies complexity"". Your complaint is that the title sells away the ending, right? Bresson has never cared about the outcomes; instead, his humanity testaments focus on the struggle of life itself given a set of circumstances. That's why he's misunderstood: not all people have fought for their lives even once.97/100 ***",5.0,"{'neg': 0.119, 'neu': 0.708, 'pos': 0.172, 'compound': 0.811}",0.811,pos,pos

Directors typically use long tracking shots for immersion, to draw the audience in; that’s probably not new information for anyone that happens to be reading this review, but the way Tarr uses them draws the audience in, through the 39 shots in the 145 minutes of this film, even the most mundane actions are enthralling. After all, Werckmeister Harmonies isn’t necessarily focusing on that eruption of violence, but rather the quiet moments of humanity in this situation; making the violence all the more brutal and tragic. ***",5.0,"{'neg': 0.249, 'neu': 0.716, 'pos': 0.035, 'compound': -0.9841}",-0.9841,neg,pos

The choice of colors and cinematography makes it flow like poetry. Especially, the scene where Hidetora leaves the castle leaves you awestruck.

Its quiet, slow, methodical, bleak and without a lot of explosions and violence, but instead a lot of tension, paranoia and dread.

It gets worse as it gets better, and heritage is a grim lifelong weight burning as the future glides closer. Apu needs a prayer, a break, a stroke of mercy. Yet it doesn’t come.

The two main actors (who are twenty years younger than their characters) give an accurate and convincing performance as grandparents, and the aging make-up effects are fantastic. It’s a devastating film that pulls at your heartstrings when it effectively raises awareness on the common lack of empathy towards seniors. It’s about the decline of a family, how elders are discarded, and the young spirit that is yet still lurking inside old people. ***",4.5,"{'neg': 0.119, 'neu': 0.741, 'pos': 0.14, 'compound': 0.3612}",0.3612,neu,pos

The segment where the children realise the horror of being kept in a nightmarish abusive home is brilliant directing.

Solaris,1972,Andrei Tarkovsky, ★★★★★ ," Tarkovsky considered “Solaris” his own least favorite work because it was too much of a genre film; a classification he always sought to elude. While “Solaris” does not entirely escape some of the tropes of science fiction, Tarkovsky only proves his own thesis in its making. Whether man travels to space, to the Zone, or even just across the span of his own time, he lugs his own faulty desires with him. And, just as depicted with trademark Tarkovsky hypnotic mastery in “Solaris,” this is both selfish, and the most deeply human of acts - worthy in its failure of all the love the universe can muster. ***",5.0,"{'neg': 0.109, 'neu': 0.83, 'pos': 0.06, 'compound': -0.5879}",-0.5879,neg,pos

No closure is offered; resentments are left unvented, problems remain unsolved, but they are collectively acknowledged, and even understood by these characters.

(First and only viewing was 13 years ago; I'm not sure what stage of metamorphosis my taste had reached at that point.)

Their innocent joy, little dreams and happiness, oblivious about the extremity of the circumstance they are in, makes it all the more harder to see them struggle, dragging one through a whole spectrum of emotions. It’s a tough slow paced mentally exhaustive watch with a 140 mins runtime, but if you can give in the time there is a lot to draw from it.

This type of cinema requires the upmost patience, and that I shall try to muster.

The execution is masterful, and the pay-off is even better. The resolution is entirely cathartic. It’s also incredibly well-choreographed, touching, and surprisingly exciting.

The Wages of Fear,1953,Henri-Georges Clouzot, ★★★★½ , Characters are so focused on proving themselves to the point of creating an environment devoid of empathy.

Corporations that will obtain wealth and power at the cost of people truly developing community among each without the need of violent actions. Characters become at odds with each other when everyone’s true desires eventually clash with one another. Characters trying to control life rather than trying to make the best of their limitations.

The tragedy of the film lies in the innocence with which two kids see the world that they are traveling alone. There are many things that they don’t understand and they suffer from cruelties in the search for an ideal that may not even exist. Culminating in some truly tragic scenes, Landscape in the Mist is absolutely devastating. ***",5.0,"{'neg': 0.217, 'neu': 0.711, 'pos': 0.072, 'compound': -0.9577}",-0.9577,neg,pos

And here, conversations bloom and meanings unfold out of simple activities: writing, eating, changing clothes, peeling an apple. Shots are low and static and exquisitely composed, with characters walking in and out of shot; intimate and poignant.

Of course some voluntarily chose that path, but I think Aftersun reminds us that regret and despondency doesn’t wilt away simply because we’ve created life.

Everything builds as an eerie and heart-pounding score adds layers of uncertainty to an already nervous experience. This all builds to our final few sequences which mesmerized me and solidified Harakiri as not only the greatest samurai film ever made, but one of the best films ever made. ***",5.0,"{'neg': 0.083, 'neu': 0.807, 'pos': 0.109, 'compound': 0.7055}",0.7055,pos,pos

Masaki Kobayashi's direction feels even more fluid here, with a tighter plot that focuses on fleshing out the characterisation of Kaji. And in doing so, the acting of Tatsuya Nakadai evolves into utter brilliance. If the final part is anywhere near his level here, which I can only presume it will be, then Nakadai's performance might become one of my all-time favourites. ***",5.0,"{'neg': 0.023, 'neu': 0.913, 'pos': 0.065, 'compound': 0.6486}",0.6486,pos,pos

It's a film comprised of footsteps, whispers, minor errors, minor victories, and the celebratory rush of triumph over hardship. While most films ""fade to black"" to signify an end or a particular moment of importance, the key to A Man Escaped is its usage of the fade as an assured step into danger and the reluctant quest for hope.

Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans is a nocturnal fairground of frightful twists and turns, its towering set pieces and timeless visual technique dripping with effortless style. George O’Brien’s lurking presence practically resurrects the image of Nosferatu, Janet Gaynor’s hysterical fear furthering the scare-factor. More than ninety-three years old and still immeasurable in its ability to surprise, Sunrise is surely silent film at its most vivid and powerful.
