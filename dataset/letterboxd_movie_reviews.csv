Harakiri,1962,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★★ , honor in the individual is virtue honor in a society is madness ***
Harakiri,1962,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★½ ," Firstly, I must apologise for holding off on this for so long. This is remarkable. It’s a film that raises a lot of issues about whether fervent loyalty to the code of honour is more valuable than humanity. And how that is unjustifiable. The execution is masterful, and the pay-off is even better. The resolution is entirely cathartic. It’s also incredibly well-choreographed, touching, and surprisingly exciting. I do think that I will need another watch in order to fully digest everything, though. ***"
Harakiri,1962,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★★ ," God damn what an impeccable film. Not dated in the least, if you tried to tell this same story now, 60 years later, this would still be the best way to tell it, shot for shot, line for line.I sometimes get intimidated by the fact that there is so much great film, both past and present, that I could never find time to see it all. Japan alone has way too many incredible filmmakers with extensive filmographies I’ve barely scraped the surface of. I don’t know what was in the water over there throughout the 20th century, but it must’ve been good. ***"
Harakiri,1962,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★★ ," Probably the greatest film ever.. a film about honour, valour, poverty, hunger , justice and the politics.. a fable that is as relevant today as when it was made.. totally blown ***"
Harakiri,1962,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★★ ," Immediately pulls you in with its captivating simultaneous story-telling, which rings of mystery and intrigue as the plot thickens and builds. There’s so much beauty in intimate and heartbreaking dialogue, and this films display of powerful rhetoric, equally as thoughtful as it can be emotionally jarring, is absolute class. Everything builds as an eerie and heart-pounding score adds layers of uncertainty to an already nervous experience. This all builds to our final few sequences which mesmerized me and solidified Harakiri as not only the greatest samurai film ever made, but one of the best films ever made. ***"
Harakiri,1962,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★★ ," ""Who can fathom the depths of another man's heart?"" ***"
Harakiri,1962,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★★ ," wait can we normalize calling something you’ve only seen once, your favorite movie of all time? ***"
Harakiri,1962,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★★ ," Went in with high expectations and boy were they fucking fulfilled. The word masterpiece is thrown around a lot, often too much, but in the case of Harakiri its 110% justified. Simply astonishing. ***"
Harakiri,1962,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★★ ," it's frankly quite embarrassing how often I find myself at a loss for words, but it's a consolation to know that when this film is concerned, words probably wouldn't even come close to doing it justice anyway ***"
Harakiri,1962,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★★ ," ""...a man of some acquaintance to me.""my first masaki kobayashi film dares me to review it, knowing i cant. some shots tell more stories, reveal more history, and immortalize myths better than any scene involving dialogue ever could. i want my heart back, masaki kobayashi. ***"
Harakiri,1962,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★★ , a japanese action samurai movie about a dude trying to kill himself the director made this movie for me he told me himself!! ***
Harakiri,1962,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★★ , Ain't got much to say here to be honest. It's just one of the greatest films ever made isn't it?If you've seen it then you know and if you haven't just do yourself a favour and go watch this classic. ***
Harakiri,1962,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★½ , Both Spider-verses are better than this94/100 ***
Harakiri,1962,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★★ ," The resolve of the broken in the face of expiry. A partition of prestige veils the sanctimonious. One man willing to sacrifice his life for his own personal cause; Hanshirō dedicated everything to a morality that ruthlessly betrayed him, and in setting out to take his revenge, he reveals the moral hypocrisies of Bushidō, which prove to be more damning to his antagonists than any amount of malefic bloodshed he could inflict.But blood will be spilled. It will rain crimson at the feet of their Gods, and no attempts at swift concealment can ever suture the gaping wounds revealed by the truth. ***"
Harakiri,1962,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★★ ," How dare Masaki Kobayashi steal the climatic scene from Kill Bill without giving it credit? What a shameless man. This film should be avoided at all- just joking. Hara-kiri is japanese filmmaking at its best, fascinating use of lighting and music. 20 minutes in and I've already decided that this film is definitely going into my top 10 best films of all time list, exceeding both Seven Samurai and Rashomon. Going to give Takashi Miike's remake a try. I fucking love samurais, man. ***"
Harakiri,1962,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★ ," Great movie but every time they name-dropped the ""Sengoku clan"" all I could think about was the one and only Nadeko Sengoku from the Monogatari seriesEdit: here's another gif cause why not 😌 ***"
Harakiri,1962,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★★ ," Literally I just wanna kill myself by harakiri, because I have no words for this movie; this is just perfectly a masterpiece! ***"
Harakiri,1962,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★½ , this jidaigeki film is so beautifully shot—delightsome cinematography. the technicalities are so ahead of the time. plot is also captivating enough; it skillfully introduces you to the culture of japan back then. you can definitely see that this film serves as a major inspiration to a roster of contemporary filmmakers nowadays. i might watch some samurai films more because of this. ***
Harakiri,1962,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★★ , This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  I actually thought Hanshiro Tsugumo would win the end battle.  ***
Harakiri,1962,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★ ," 100-word review: Rōnin Tsugumo requests to commit harakiri within the manor of a lord, who thinks he's being scammed. Kobayashi's Harakiri — the Letterbox top 250 number three — is a film I inexplicably forgot about having seen twice already, which I'm incredibly thankful for, considering whatever unfathomable reason made it not stick with me before certainly didn't rear its ugly head again. First time giving a samurai film such a positive score, chiefly for finely balancing familiar genre ideas with excellent storytelling, and for being both singularly poignant storywise, and singularly critical of the samurai honour culture, when compared to geo-historical contemporaries. ***"
Come and See,1985,Elem Klimov, ★★★★★ , as soon as this film ended i went online and enlisted in the US army. no child will ever suffer like this again on my watch ***
Come and See,1985,Elem Klimov, ★★★★★ , What a horrible nightmare! ***
Come and See,1985,Elem Klimov, ★★★★½ , (guy who's still buzzing from Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse) this is significantly less fun than Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. ***
Come and See,1985,Elem Klimov, ★★★★★ , apparently elem klimov wanted to name this film kill hitler and i think that's beautiful ***
Come and See,1985,Elem Klimov, ★★★★★ ," 100%, no doubt in my mind, this is the best film ever made. I cannot believe this is real, I'm so fucking glad I saw this in theaters. ***"
Come and See,1985,Elem Klimov, ★★★★★ , Playing this at my grandma’s bingo party next week. ***
Come and See,1985,Elem Klimov, ★★★★★ ," An apocalyptic nightmare of pure brutalizing evil shot and sequenced in intimate, hyperreal historical detail. Unbearable extreme close-ups of its witnesses and beautiful roaming camera moves (ensuring we see even what the characters maybe miss) that in tandem form a series of vivid, unsparing, and surreal vignettes around the psychological experience of unimaginably barbaric horror being made tangible. You can practically smell the mud and fire and corpses, and just like the young boy in this film I too feel like I just aged 100 years in 2 hours. ***"
Come and See,1985,Elem Klimov, ★★★★★ , One of the greatest films ever made. Period. ***
Come and See,1985,Elem Klimov, None ," Francois Truffaut once said that it is impossible to make a truly anti-war film, because depictions of war are thrilling by their very nature. I know he said this because I’ve heard it quoted ten thousand times, always by people who are about to name a movie that is an exception to Truffaut’s maxim. Safe to say at this point that he was wrong. Idiot. Let’s ratio him. ***"
Come and See,1985,Elem Klimov, ★★★★★ , One can’t help but wonder what Taika Waititi would have done with this material ***
Come and See,1985,Elem Klimov, ★★★★★ , this makes other WWII movies look like a ride at disney world ***
Come and See,1985,Elem Klimov, ★★★★★ ," One of the more upsetting experiences I've had in a long time, and a true document of evil so disturbing, only human beings could fathom such horror. The fact everything on screen actually occurred on my planet is proof we're doomed as a species...eventually, maybe not in our lifetime. ***"
Come and See,1985,Elem Klimov, ★★★★★ ," fuck.. this film was so difficult to watch but it needed to be made. i've never seen anything so brutal and devastating. and because of that i'll probably never watch it again..but you really only need to see it once, its unforgettable. ***"
Come and See,1985,Elem Klimov, ★★★★★ , Best war movie ever made. ***
Come and See,1985,Elem Klimov, ★★★★★ , An experience. ***
Come and See,1985,Elem Klimov, ★★★★★ ," Come And See…? No thanks 🙈But for real, this film scarred me more than 90% of the horror films I’ve watched so far. It proves that we humans are far worse than we’ve actually thought. ***"
Come and See,1985,Elem Klimov, ★★★★★ ," Years before the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the boundaries within the war genre are pushed one last time. So, even by the 80s, the WWII topic seemed overused, but the approach that Klimov had towards the psychological impact a human soul could possess over consciousness and rationality is breathtaking. Moreover, the last ""flashback"" montage is one of the most intense sequences you will be ever able to see. Instantly, Idi i Smotri belongs to a superior category of cinema with absolutely invigorating imagery and suicidal chaos. It's no joyous or action-oriented trip of entertainment: it is authentic horror, flawlessly filmed. Be prepared.99/100 ***"
Come and See,1985,Elem Klimov, ★★★★★ , makes Saving Private Ryan looks like a child movie ***
Come and See,1985,Elem Klimov, ★★★★★ ," Seeing this in a theater with other people quietly sniffling during the ending and then everyone getting up to leave the theater in dead silence is an unforgettable experience, not ashamed to admit I was holding back tears during the final moments. ***"
Come and See,1985,Elem Klimov, ½ , He looks like Ellen the generous ***
12 Angry Men,1957,Sidney Lumet, ★★★★★ , That was the best 1.5 hours of middle aged white dudes yelling at each other that I've ever seen. ***
12 Angry Men,1957,Sidney Lumet, ★★★★★ , when they all start ignoring the racist... one of the best scenes in cinema history there is no reasonable doubt! ***
12 Angry Men,1957,Sidney Lumet, ★★★★ , the 3 best angry men1. henry fonda2. mustache 3. dude who doesn't sweat the 3 worst angry men1. the one who wants to go to his stupid baseball game shut the fuck up oh my god2. racist3. racist ***
12 Angry Men,1957,Sidney Lumet, ★★★★½ ," funny how a b&w studio film from the 50s that takes place all in one room directly addressed systemic racism, xenophobia, and toxic masculinity better than most movies coming out now ***"
12 Angry Men,1957,Sidney Lumet, ★★★★★ , it's unbelievable how many times i started counting these angry men when they were all in the same shot. newsflash: they were always 12 ***
12 Angry Men,1957,Sidney Lumet, ★★★★★ , Someone's gotta make an edit of this movie where they add Ace Attorney music and sound effects ***
12 Angry Men,1957,Sidney Lumet, ★★★★★ , A new favorite. I feel dumb trying to summarize what I loved about an already established masterpiece because I know so many others have done so much better. All I’ll say is that it’s perfect in pretty much every way. A film that does literally no wrong and goes above and beyond what it needed to do. Gonna watch it again as soon as I get through these next 10 films.MASTAPIECE  ***
12 Angry Men,1957,Sidney Lumet, ★★★★★ , literally cheered when all 12 men became angry ***
12 Angry Men,1957,Sidney Lumet, ★★★★★ ," Absolutely one of the best classics. It's strange to describe a film taking place almost entirely in one room as thrilling, but 12 Angry Men was. As was it gripping and terrifically acted. I'm rarely so engrossed in classic, all-dialogue, black and white films, but 12 Angry Men is an exception, and an exceptional one. ***"
12 Angry Men,1957,Sidney Lumet, ★★★★ , i never thought i'd be so thrilled to see a bunch of white men arguing for an hour and a half ***
12 Angry Men,1957,Sidney Lumet, ★★★★★ , guess you could say that I couldn't be any fonda of this film ***
12 Angry Men,1957,Sidney Lumet, ★★★½ ," loved this reference to veronica mars season 2 episode 10 ""one angry veronica"" ***"
12 Angry Men,1957,Sidney Lumet, ★★★★★ , I've never had Jury duty but I'm pretty sure this sets up a completely unrealistic standard for how exciting it would be. ***
12 Angry Men,1957,Sidney Lumet, ★★★★★ ," Oh, you love 12 Angry Men? Name every angry man. ***"
12 Angry Men,1957,Sidney Lumet, ★★★★★ ," watched at an open air movie theatre. when you have watched a movie three months ago for the first time and watching it again, this time on the big screen, three months later, remembering most of the details, and still being glued to the screen... you know something has been done right ***"

Seven Samurai,1954,Akira Kurosawa, ★★★★★ ," ""Once again, we survive."" ***"
Seven Samurai,1954,Akira Kurosawa, ★★★★★ ," “This baby is me, this is what happened to me.”violence is endless and the repercussions eternal, the flames rage on as the innocents die. however, what Kurosawa also realises is that violence is the coolest thing that you can ever capture on celluloid. that central dichotomy, the merging of visceral horror and shameful pleasure at the sight of violence, is part of what makes Seven Samurai so timeless. one second, you’ll witness the sadness of a dying innocent, the other you’ll be cheering the slaughter of an enemy combatant. either way, a mother loses their child, a child loses their father. ***"
Seven Samurai,1954,Akira Kurosawa, ★★★★★ ," So massive, so satisfying and so honest about the cost of violence. Did it in two nights with the 7 year old. Kid's got a major Mifune crush. Me too. ***"
Seven Samurai,1954,Akira Kurosawa, ★★★ ," I was going to give this 3 1/2, but then people would be all like ""oh you thought it was pretty good?"" and I can't say I thought that.I mean it was a great film for sure, but it was so hard for me to get into.Nothing hit me.Nothing made me think or feel until the last 40 minutes. It's way too long.The production and art direction were so well done, but the story and characters just weren't there for me.I really wanted to love this, but it didn't work for me.I appreciated it.I didn't really like it. ***"

Seven Samurai,1954,Akira Kurosawa, ★★★★½ , Yep. I counted ***
Seven Samurai,1954,Akira Kurosawa, ★★★★★ ," An epic tale held together firmly by all seven major characters, with so much attention invested into each of them that the entire story would deviate devastatingly if even one was removed. The simplest action like sticking a katana on dirt, or a flag on a roof, feels like a time-transcending elegy. All actions are exaggerated to amplify emotions, the evergreen comedic moments effortlessly connect audiences across decades. Features the most playful and the most uncool performance by cool samurai Toshiro Mifune. Kurosawa's most powerful and most defining work in his entire career. ***"

High and Low,1963,Akira Kurosawa, None ," Had the pleasure of watching this film for the first time on 35mm thanks to The Cinematheque in Vancouver. It was the first film in the series High Art Films Made from Pop Art Sources curated by Donald Brackett. Brackett intro'd the film.Great film by a great master. Incredibly tight Tohoscope framing which should be studied for how to frame groups of characters in a 2.35 frame. trivia: Pulp Fiction's ""Swing Dance Scene"" was inspired by the incredible real time dance scene in the last act of High and Low. Watched on 35mm at Vancouver's Cinematheque ***"
High and Low,1963,Akira Kurosawa, ★★★★★ ," A masterpiece of Noir/police procedural that spares not a single detail. This movie is part of a lineage of painstaking procedurals about the investigation of a crime that become a forensic examination of the society in which they occur. It goes M--->High and Low--->The Boston Strangler--->Memories of Murder--->Zodiac. The first 50 minutes of this takes places entirely in a guy's living room and just with how he composes people in space--entering a room, getting up, sitting down--Kurosawa shows you absolutely everything you need to know about feel about the action thats taking place. Masterclass, tears in my eyes. ***"

High and Low,1963,Akira Kurosawa, ★★★★★ ," Belongs on every list of the most anxiety inducing movies ever made. Akira Kurosawa is one of the all-time greatest, and this is one of his very finest movies.Kurosawa's pitch-perfect filmmaking is only made all the more gripping by poignant social commentary - as this mystery slowly unfolds into watching a man's descent down the hierarchical class structure in order to see eye to eye with the criminal he's after.This is one of the all-time greatest. We don't deserve Kurosawa's films. ***"

The whole nine and half hours is worth it...it's all worth it.

The Human Condition III: A Soldier's Prayer,1961,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★★ ," The best trilogy in cinema I got the pleasure in witnessing. Masaki Kobayashi made a trilogy of masterpieces. My first ever three perfect ratings for a trilogy. Even viewing Harakiri and Kwaidan before, I was not prepared for a masterclass of filmmaking for 10 hours. Grabbing the reality of war, a depressing era for humanity. The effects war has on human beings. The complex realism of psychological warfare the minds can only dwell on for so long. Having faith in a hopeless cruel world. Truly a shame no many have seen this brilliant piece of art. Kobayashi, a directing legend. ***"

The Human Condition III: A Soldier's Prayer,1961,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★★ ," #RamadhanDay21this part was emotionally draining. The cinematography remained very stark in black and white. There is more tension in this part because history does not determine how it will come out. And there is more action in the flight sequences as characters come and go, and it's never clear when danger will suddenly emerge. ***"

The Human Condition III: A Soldier's Prayer,1961,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★★ ," There couldn't have been a better conclusion. My favorite of the saga because of the plot and the overarching connections with the previous entries and the overall emotion it stirrs up in its audience. Oh, and remember what I said about Kubrick in my previous review? Yeah, he totally homaged (or copied, again) the ending of this film in The Shining.Full review of the entire saga coming soon.#25 on: ""My Top 250 Favorite Films of All-Time""On my ""Movies That Made Me Cry"" list ***"
The Human Condition III: A Soldier's Prayer,1961,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★½ , An amazing war film that I bet would hit a lot harder if I’d seen the first 2 in the trilogy. ***
The Human Condition III: A Soldier's Prayer,1961,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★ ," Masaki Kobayashi concludes his monumental exploration of human nature with A Soldier's Prayer, a work that vehemently denounces the injustice and cruelty that humans are capable of, and a severe criticism of the actions and values of the Japanese army during the Second World War. Once again, we follow Kaji on his inner journey and efforts to survive violence and dehumanization in order to fulfil his longed-for dream of returning home to his beloved Michiko. The Human Condition is a beautiful and indisputable anti-war poem, a thoughtful and profound drama that reveals, like few other works, the complexity and contradictions of the human being. ***"
The Human Condition III: A Soldier's Prayer,1961,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★½ ," A fittingly harrowing conclusion to this excellent trilogy. This one has by far the most beautiful cinematography out of the three. What a journey this has been. Truly one of the most impressive epics of all time, especially if viewed as one movie. ***"

The Human Condition III: A Soldier's Prayer,1961,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★★ ," Esta, la tercera parte de 'La condición Humana', es la exposición completa de Kaji (Tatsuya Nakadai); muchas de sus ideas deben reprimirse sí desea sobrevivir; la vida y el trato humano que tanto ha defendido en las dos primeras partes convergen en un instinto de supervivencia que choca directamente con sus principios de forma visceral. ***"

Yi Yi,2000,Edward Yang, ★★★★★ ," Life captured in a film.Edward Yang's YI YI just became one of my all-time favorite movies on a second viewing. Such an intimate, understated yet ultimately deeply affecting slice of life epic. One of the first masterpieces of the 21st-century. ***"

Yi Yi,2000,Edward Yang, ★★★★★ ," probably the closest a movie has ever come to replicating the effect of john williams' stoner and that is the highest compliment i can ever give, staggeringly powerful, the kind of work that makes the world a better place, the kind of work that fills you with optimism and sadness and heartbreak but more than anything, this overwhelming sensation of love. a movie that makes me believe that life is worth it. ***"
Yi Yi,2000,Edward Yang, ★★★★★ ," So many of life’s most personal moments set against reflections of the outside world. A world that, at times, feels cruelly indifferent to our struggles and at other times understanding and encompassing of them. Not at all unlike the back of someone’s head. We all look a little less like ourselves and a little more like each other when viewed from behind. We just need someone else’s help to see that. ***"

We're never afraid of getting up every morning. Why?"" -Ota, Family. I feel a bit powerless when it comes to giving this a proper review. It's a lovely exploration of family and how members of families impact each other. It's also a reminder that each member of a family is an individual going through their own shit.

Yi Yi,2000,Edward Yang, None ," ""My uncle says we live three times as long since man invented movies...

Yi Yi,2000,Edward Yang, ★★★★★ ," Certain truths are hard to see, but sometimes, our secrets can be found hiding in plain sight: reflected in windows, cast in shadow, or in the studied eyes of loved ones. In our youth, they appear ambiguous, fixed high above, beyond our interest or understanding. As we age, we remember them as we knew them then to be. What we perceive as the present appears in front of us; only with the help of another can we see how far we’ve come. A photograph is simply one side of the truth—we all have our own stories that tell another.I feel older now myself. ***"
Yi Yi,2000,Edward Yang, ★★★★★ ," a chorus of voices and the increasingly cavernous spaces they echo within, like discovering that every locale that you've taken for granted is a sort of abstract imitation dollhouse where you constantly repeat the same mistakes that were built into you by an unknown master, reflecting on a life you never lived with people you've never known in a home you've never owned, tired, familiarity, the heartache of being too close for comfort.memories of the city. ***"
Yi Yi,2000,Edward Yang, ★★★★★ ," Tremendous collage of wonderful personifications of urban modernity.

Schindler's List,1993,Steven Spielberg, ★★★★ ," Don’t get me wrong this is a very good movie, with some amazing cinematography. I just feel that all of the five star ratings are rating the emotional impact of the Holocaust more than the filmmaking itself. Personally feel the director of photography Janusz Kamiński brings much more to the film than Spielberg dose. While their are some flaws particularly in the first act, this is still an excellently crafted, and very important movie that deserves your full attention. ***"

In conclusion, Schindler List is a masterful film. ***"

Schindler's List,1993,Steven Spielberg, ★★★★½ , - 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die -One of the most devasting but powerful films I've ever seen. I don't think any of us will ever come close to understanding the sheer terror and destruction they had to go through.

Schindler's List,1993,Steven Spielberg, ★★★★★ ," Shamefully, today's viewing was my first one. It was a difficult watch, but I expected as much. I feel like my words will only dilute the experience I had with this monumental movie, so let me just say that Schindler's List is required viewing, not just for film fans, but for everyone. It will forever remain required viewing. I am going to make an effort to revisit this at least annually.Watched with a sniffling Michelle. ***"
Ikiru,1952,Akira Kurosawa, ★★★★★ ," ""I can't afford to hate people. I haven't got that kind of time.""While I was watching this, I kept forgetting that it was made in '52. Ikiru is an amazing movie, and probably my new favorite of its respective decade. The social commentary, especially in the third act, is spot on... possibly even more relevant today. The black and white photography is simply beautiful, and Takashi Shimura's lead performance as Watanabe is something to marvel over. Rarely have I seen such genuine sadness on an actor's face; it's something that I'll never forget. Essential viewing for all human beings on Planet Earth. ***"

Ikiru,1952,Akira Kurosawa, ★★★★ ," It is called ""To Live"" and when the protagonist decides to do so, people in the background starts to sing ""happy birthday"", let's just say that even by Kurosawa's ""captain obvious"" standards, Ikiru is not subtle. Yet, movies are to be lived not read, and Ikiru is so expansive, so detailed in its imagination of that man's final days and Shimura's performance of it so affecting that nothing like that matters. Every underlined image hit like they are fresh and unexpected. Mr Watanabe wounds so real, Kurosawa's in your face approach just making it more so. ***"

Ikiru,1952,Akira Kurosawa, ★★★★★ ," The most amusing figure is the drunken novelist (Yunosuke Ito) who learns of Watanabe’s fate and insists on leading him through a night of comically poeticized debauchery in order to make up for lost time. Ito’s arrival couldn’t come at a better time, for just as Ikiru is threatening to be an obvious, self-satisfied “lesson” movie, here is a clown who bemoans, in a sake slur, that we only appreciate life when death is upon us. After espousing the movie’s supposed moral, he promptly fails to learn from it.Full review here. ***"

I was immediately absorbed into this story and I couldn’t look away even when faced with the brutality and violence in this story. I like that unlike most of the other gangster or mob stories I’ve seen, this one never feels glamorous or inviting. It is grim and dirty and deeply sad. I really like the choice of the narrator because seeing this story through the eyes of a spectator gave us a sort of arial view of everyone instead of being pulled into one side. Brilliant film, I loved it. ***"

La Haine,1995,Mathieu Kassovitz, ★★★★ ," the way this film builds so much tension in how it forces us to watch time tick away, causing us to say to ourselves “so far, so good. so far, so good”. until the ending hits with a thud. because it’s all about the fall. and because we all know & live the story – the way it circles back & always stays relevant, the falling never ends. ***"

There are plenty of interesting camera angles and cinematic shots; it truly manages to capture your attention this way. It has a dense script that’s written true to its characters and filled with perfect comedic timing.It’s a film about how hatred breeds hatred, and the lack of control towards this conflict is all the more frustrating. There’s also philosophical themes on insignificance and existentialism, which completely fit the story. The only disappointing part about this movie is that I can’t think of anything else like this. ***"

La Haine,1995,Mathieu Kassovitz, ★★★★ ," 79/100[originally written on my blog]Because Kassovitz has done nothing worthwhile since, I was prepared to wonder what the hell I was thinking back then. Instead, I'm wondering what the hell happened, because he fully deserved his Best Director prize at Cannes. If only a tiny fraction of the handheld, slice-of-urban-life indies I endure every year were half as formally accomplished as this freewheeling powder keg. Performances feel credibly spontaneous without ever becoming mired in improvisational awkwardness, and the loose-limbed, episodic structure keeps defusing urgency to invigorating effect. Only the Chekhovian gun and inevitable violent ending disappoint. One-hit wonder. ***"
La Haine,1995,Mathieu Kassovitz, ★★★★ ," Review juice has been low lately, but I liked this. I expected it to be rough around the edges but really harsh and gritty, but it’s surprisingly elegant at times. Definitely feels like someone watched a lot of good movies and Frankensteined them into a new thing, but it’s organic enough that I didn’t mind. I sure wish it didn’t end with “we live in a society,” but I’ll take what I can get. I wish this review weren’t comprised entirely of compound sentences with the same coordinating conjunction, but I’m not gonna go back and revise it. ***"

Instead of a poor man who discovers the meaning of true wealth after a lifetime of sacrifice, a rich man discovers the meaning of true poverty after a lifetime of ruthless self-interest. The fact that these are two of my favorite films is perhaps not a coincidence, and probably very telling of my tastes and personal beliefs. ***"

The storytelling is flawless, incorporating themes of family- honor- respect- power- betrayal- revenge- forgiveness- loyalty in an organic and engaging manner. The choice of colors and cinematography makes it flow like poetry. Especially, the scene where Hidetora leaves the castle leaves you awestruck.

Ran,1985,Akira Kurosawa, ★★★★ ," men possessed by a spirit of conflict, dressing themselves in the rhetoric of peace only after they've built their kingdoms atop a mountain of skulls. kurosawa is the supreme architect of human fallibility; you feel the deep sadness he has that man is unable to loosen his grip on violence even as he knows and bemoans a history full of butchery, a contradiction that refuses to sublimate itself into a supposedly 'clean' era of progress. ***"
Ran,1985,Akira Kurosawa, ★★★★★ ," Ran is a movie that celebrated Japanese film director Akira Kurosawa doubtlessly planned as his last extraordinary cinematic statement. He consumed more than ten painstaking years on large hand-painted illustrations that ultimately served as storyboards, and he surrendered the stylistic cuts that distinguished his earlier work for a more static perspective. It narratively reimagines Shakespeare’s King Lear against a feudal background and is his second Shakespeare adaptation after Throne of Blood (based on Macbeth) in 1957. This movie is a tour de force, and it is filled with some of the best-choreographed action sequences in cinematic history ***"

In Edward Yang's other masterpiece Yi Yi, there's a quote about how movies make us feel as if we've lived three lives, and with this movie it feels more like thirteen, each one more fulfilling than the last. ***"

A Brighter Summer Day,1991,Edward Yang, ★★★★★ ," Love Migraine. Distilled into aching injustice. There were zero identities left behind, people failed to attain the goals of putting on a mask, like when the chances on winning from betting on horses were low. During that time, it was all about Elvis Presley. But the schools were getting warmer, like a heat that could turn into flames, so the skies reddened and turned into a different kind of orange. Or was anything really happening at all? When you start feeling something in your abdomen, this is going to start sizzling very, very soon.Why do you think I'm not a person? ***"
A Brighter Summer Day,1991,Edward Yang, ★★★★★ ," ""The primary defining feature of A Brighter Summer Day, and all epics like it, is that its storytelling is circular, not linear; it flows through a time and space for these characters, but not on the character’s behalf, it isn’t cloyingly tethered to Xiao’s life in the way that it would be in a shorter, more compact version of its story. The strength of the epic is that it instead prefers to create the space for meanings to arise . . .""one of my patrons requested that i write an essay about this great masterpiece, which you can read the rest of here! ***"

The Human Condition I: No Greater Love,1959,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★ ," - World Cinema Is The Best Cinema -As the incredible performances are accompanied by the breathtaking cinematography, the first instalment of The Human Condition trilogy is a devastating visualisation of humanity and how horribly we have treated our own kind. As a result of that, this is probably one of the most powerful anti-war films out there and I can imagine the rest of the trilogy projects the same views and sets up for an incredible experience. ***"
The Human Condition I: No Greater Love,1959,Masaki Kobayashi, None ," I can’t dispute Kobayashi’s masterful depiction of this deeply moralistic tale about pacifism in the face of violence. It’s brutal, beautiful, and ultimately incredibly harrowing. However this is one third, one act in a longer story. Mentally, I am hungry for more. Emotionally, I am drained. Physically, I am sleepy. This type of cinema requires the upmost patience, and that I shall try to muster. But my 21st-century sensibilities are so suited to short-form entertainment that this is truly stretching me to my limits. It seems The Human Condition Trilogy is as much an exploration of human adversity for its characters as it is for its audience! ***"
The Human Condition I: No Greater Love,1959,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★★ ," Yeah, this is CINEMA. Feels like I’ve been stalling on this trilogy for years and I’m fuming, the runtime is admittedly daunting... however it’s completely justified. I’m so glad I decided to purchase a blu ray copy with exquisite restoration quality, it also helps that I’m off work for 2 weeks so I can fully commit the 10 hours required. The film looks beautiful, is paced to perfection, morally challenges it’s audience to the extent few films do and is topped off with an excellent performance from Tatsuya Nakadai. Looking forward to Part 2. ***"
The Human Condition I: No Greater Love,1959,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★★ ," #RamadhanDay20Kaji = Oscar Schindlerthis film expresses perfectly the idea that everybody is the same, so we need to treat people like human and not slave or subhuman. ***"
The Human Condition I: No Greater Love,1959,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★½ ," The first part of the mammoth that is The Human Condition, No Greater Love introduces us to an epic of persevering pacifism. Masaki Kobayashi feels at home, and it is clearly here where his thematic trademarks had begun evincing. A spectacularly crafted and marvelously shot tale of humanism and moralism, and an incredibly investing protagonist in the form of Kaji, which is impeccably performed by the legendary Tatsuya Nakadai.I will continue with the rest of the trilogy in the forthcoming days. ***"
The Human Condition I: No Greater Love,1959,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★★ , A masterpiece. Flawless framing and staging. Sublime performances. Not a single moment wasted. One of the best directed films I’ve ever seen. ***
The Human Condition I: No Greater Love,1959,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★½ ," Definitely One of the greatest anti-war Films of all time, i don't know what took me so long to watch this MASTERPIECE... Great start to what i think it's gonna be an EPIC Trilogy. ***"
The Human Condition I: No Greater Love,1959,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★½ ," What a powerful and heart-wrenching movie this was. A Brutal and moving anti-war film.War really brings out the worst in humanity, and this movie explores just how hard it can be stick to your principles when everyone around you wants you to be as ruthless as possible. I can't wait to see the next two films of the trilogy. ***"
The Human Condition I: No Greater Love,1959,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★½ ," Masaki Kobayashi's first film of the 10 hour trilogy is a major achievement in cinema. It is long and gruelling, but worth it. Kaji, a labour camp supervisor is tormented by ethics and morals as he struggles to make the decisions required in wartime. Meanwhile he has just married the love of his life. The ending is particular devastating and there are some quite brutal moments.I look forward to the next two chapters. ***"
The Human Condition I: No Greater Love,1959,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★½ ," This definitely wasn’t what I was expecting from this film, I was thinking it would be straight into the frontlines guns and explosions and shit but I’m soo glad this film is the way it is. Kaji is so interesting and I’m excited to see where his character goes over the next two films. ***"
The Human Condition I: No Greater Love,1959,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★★ ," Criterion Challenge 2022 Week 5, Part 1 of 3. The is the first of the Human Condition trilogy and the first film is a masterpiece. One of the best war films amongst Come and See, The Ascent and Ran. The best Japanese war film I’ve seen yet. Masaki Kobayashi is already a favorite director of mine after seeing Harakiri, Kwaidan and now the first of his war trilogy. The 3 hours and 26 minutes runtime went by in a flash. I don’t want to say much cause this is a movie to experience for yourself. ***"
The Human Condition I: No Greater Love,1959,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★★ ," Brutal watch. It reminds me of the Book of Job as it’s about a man who is only trying to do good in the face of evil and oppression and yet he only gets punished and beaten by his bosses and betrayed and spit on by his workers. However, he bears it all. It’s a powerful film that is so emotionally gripping that I had to walk away a couple times. I was planning on marathoning the whole trilogy today but I don’t think I can handle it. ***"
The Human Condition I: No Greater Love,1959,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★ ," A+Kaji is one of the most intriguing cinematic characters I've ever seen. He embodies the difficulty of upholding one's own personal and humanist values that are at odds with those of a strict and harsh government.Now I need to watch the next one immediately. The film's 3hours and 26 minutes runtime flew by so quickly. I can't wait to see how they explore the themes of morality and humanity further, as well as the character development of Kaji and his struggles between conformity and personal values.(my rating for Part One may or may not change after watching the whole trilogy) ***"
The Human Condition I: No Greater Love,1959,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★½ ," The Human Condition: No Greater Love, is so well orchestrated you could almost compare it to the work of Bach, intense and powerful in its tone, with sublime composition. The way Kobayashi is able to permeate his ‘promised’ theme (The Human Condition) throughout the gripping and well paced 3 and a half hours is astonishing, and I can only imagine how great the rest of this trilogy will be. ***"
The Human Condition I: No Greater Love,1959,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★½ ," For Christmas I got THE HUMAN CONNECTION trilogy from the criterion collection. I’m overwhelmed by how great this is on a massive spectacle. Kobayashi was one of the best directors from Japan and he tackles a very daunting project, a 9 hour anti war film. No Greater Love is part one of this trilogy. It takes its time, which is to be expected for a 3+ hour movie. This is one of only a few non Kurosawa movies that I’ve seen Tatsuya Nakadai in and he’s terrific here. ***"
The Human Condition I: No Greater Love,1959,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★½ ," Honestly, and I hate to say this, it didn't live up to my expectations; as much as I enjoyed the film I don't believe it was astonishing.

The Human Condition I: No Greater Love,1959,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★★ ," Oh shit, my 2000th film on letterboxd inbound, the third film in Kobayashi's epic will be number 2000. And what a way to celebrate. A cinematic titan, this emphatic humanist drama starts off with a bang. ***"

The Dark Knight,2008,Christopher Nolan, ★★★★★ , say what you want about the joker but in this he both sanitised his hands AND wore face mask so i can definitely say he's more considerate than a lot of people ***

Paths of Glory,1957,Stanley Kubrick, ★★★★½ ," Hate to be that guy but Kubrick is so freaking good at making movies hooly shit. He did this at 28....TWENTY EIGHT. This is my new favorite (anti)war film. I will say, interesting choice on my part to watch this at 6:30am. ***"
Paths of Glory,1957,Stanley Kubrick, ★★★★★ , can letterboxd release the option to give 6 stars already ***
Paths of Glory,1957,Stanley Kubrick, ★★★★½ , Hmm war seems pretty stupid if you ask me ***
Paths of Glory,1957,Stanley Kubrick, ★★★★½ ," A 60-year-old anti-war film that feels like it could have been filmed and released last year, PATHS OF GLORY pulls no punches. It’s not just that war is hell, but that it’s a Kafka-esque enterprise pushed by men who know it’s pointless, who know it’s absurd, but who nonetheless feed the beast out of venal self-interest, outright bloodlust, or both.And it almost goes without saying that the entire trench sequence — from Kirk Douglas walking down to his battalion to the charge into No Man’s Land — is incredible, virtuosic filmmaking. The kind of accomplishment that most directors would kill to have just once in their career. ***"
Paths of Glory,1957,Stanley Kubrick, ★★★★½ , Phenomenal film about how cool war is ***
Paths of Glory,1957,Stanley Kubrick, ★★★★★ ," Not only one of the greatest anti-war films, but also one of the greatest courtroom dramas. Excels in every single regard. Kubrick made this in his late 20s, his late 20s!! ***"
Paths of Glory,1957,Stanley Kubrick, ★★★★★ ," there is no such thing as a good war movie, the only good war movie is a movie that is anti-war ***"
Paths of Glory,1957,Stanley Kubrick, ★★★★★ ," ""Now you got the edge on him.""a frightening waltz between light and dark, the powerful and the powerless. the economy of this film is just as explosive and awe-inspiring as the dialogue and horror of warfare. i need your best necromancers to bring stanley back from the dead immediately. ***"
Paths of Glory,1957,Stanley Kubrick, ★★★★★ ," I don’t really like war films, but anything like this, which is a profound anti-war message, I am sold. From the front lines, to the court room, it says a whole lot in such a little run time. That end scene, with the tear rolling down, the humming in the background, transitioning to them letting the colonel know they have to go back to the front lines… moving stuff. ***"
Paths of Glory,1957,Stanley Kubrick, ★★★★½ ," Taking place in the land of no mans,""Paths of Glory"" was hated by France.Court martialing their own,The film wasn't shown,For many years not given a chance. ***"

Paths of Glory,1957,Stanley Kubrick, ★★★★½ ," General Mireau is such a salty bitch, my god that dude deserves to catch these hands. ***"
Paths of Glory,1957,Stanley Kubrick, ★★★★½ ," Kubrick was changing the world of filmmaking way before New Hollywood came along. He just paved the road for it. Plus, it feels it feels good to watch this before Sam Mendes’ 1917 comes out showing: Yes Hollywood, WWI movies do exist. ***"
Paths of Glory,1957,Stanley Kubrick, ★★★★★ , if humanity has progressed...i wouldn't relate to this at all... ***
Paths of Glory,1957,Stanley Kubrick, ★★★★★ ," The thematic concerns of Dr. Strangelove, A Clockwork Orange, and Full Metal Jacket spiral outward in real time as repressed men turn to the pageantry of battle for release, positioning sex as violence and violence as sex until both are conflated into unrecognizability. One of the all-time great screenplays. ***"
Paths of Glory,1957,Stanley Kubrick, ★★★★ ," We're comparing this film with Wonder Woman on The Next Picture Show podcast, because both films are about World War I trench warfare, leading by example, bad leadership, and the causes of combat. Very different tones, but this cynical and sometimes painfully funny Stanley Kubrick film says a lot about the core causes of mass combat, and why it's appropriate to watch the military leadership of any country with a jaded, cautious eye. ***"
Paths of Glory,1957,Stanley Kubrick, ★★★★★ , Patriotic. A sublime exultation of power division and the senselessness of war. Kubrick starts to pave his road to auteur grandiosity in a way few directors in human history have achieved to do so. Breathtaking piece of art.98/100 ***
Paths of Glory,1957,Stanley Kubrick, ★★★★★ ," Fuck...Incredible is an understatement. One of the most powerful and moving anti-war films I've ever seen. Having a director as skilled and talented as Kubrick, at 28 no less, behind this just makes it that much stronger. Not sure why I had never watched this before today. Rewatching Strangelove last night the strong anti-war message is there and it's pretty obvious, though it's slathered with humor and satire. While this has it's satire it is also much more bleak, much more dark, and much more painful. A beautiful film, but it's such a shame that it has to exist. ***"
Paths of Glory,1957,Stanley Kubrick, ★★★★★ ," Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece, also my favorite of his films, can't believe he made this at 28 years old ***"

Apocalypse Now,1979,Francis Ford Coppola, ★★★★★ ," The rain patters deliberately. It's trying. It's trying real hard to cool off the world, but to no avail. The endless sweat parading down the faces of the losing minds and the tired souls only enhances the fever dreams and the sights of the figures within the shadows. The greatest cinematographic achievement of all time. ***"

Apocalypse Now,1979,Francis Ford Coppola, ★★★★★ ," 100 ""What are they going to say about him? What? Are they going to say he was a kind man? He was a wise man? He had plans? He had wisdom? Bullshit, man!"" Helicopter blades and bad dreams: a saga of mercy. Coppola redefines Hell as a reprieve from the jungle, for the demons couldn't possibly be as fierce or as countless as they are here, each in many forms. Probably the only movie that could attain the power of raising the dead. It moves upriver to a place sight and sound unseen. A total heart of darkness. ***"
Apocalypse Now,1979,Francis Ford Coppola, ★★★★ , more like Apocalypse Wow ***
Apocalypse Now,1979,Francis Ford Coppola, ★★★★★ ," Es wird mir auf ewig ein Rätsel bleiben, wie Coppola diesen Geniestreich zu Stande gebracht hat, aber wer immer etwas über Film lernen und das Medium lieben lernen will, der muss das hier sehen und darf dabei nicht vergessen, dass „Apocalypse Now“ zu einer Zeit entstand, als Computereffekte noch als filmischer Exzess, als Zaubertrick galten. Das Blocking, die Bildkompositionen, die visionäre Schaffenskraft - 1979 war all das nie gesehen, „Apocalypse Now“ DER Proto-Kriegsfilm, der alle folgenden Genrefilme inspirierte.Ein Geniestreich! Vielleicht einer der wichtigsten der Filmgeschichte! ***"

Apocalypse Now,1979,Francis Ford Coppola, ★★★½ ," Yes, this is a classic, but a movie that blew me away in high school is getting docked on this rewatch for just how stupid the last third or so of this movie is with Brando, playing a man who's been living on his own in the Cambodian jungle for several years leading a guerrilla army and is also morbidly obese and keeps a diary of his daily affirmations and personal philosophies like ""did you know 'if' is the in the middle of the word 'life?'"" ***"

Portrait of a Lady on Fire,2019,Céline Sciamma, ★★★★★ ," You ever find yourself staring at a bonfire? Just zoning out and watching the flame change every second, feeling the heat, the energy, the anger, the tension, you get what I’m saying.

Sunset Boulevard,1950,Billy Wilder, None , When I first moved to New York I lived in a rent controlled apartment in Chelsea with a 65 year old woman who used to wake me up at three in the morning to tell me about the 70s and who I’m about 80% sure tried to poison me when I was moving out.

Interesting how the motorized handcar sequence with that steady beat really stood out as the highlight for me. The hypnotic use of the mechanical clanking of the train accentuated with an ambient score by Eduard Artemyev really drew me in as if I was entering the ""zone"" with the characters.

Fading, slowly, yes, but you don't need to strain your ears to know it's there. The most painful part is the knowledge that every bit of happiness or sense of relief earned is short lived, like a firefly providing temporary light before wasting away, another addition onto the ever-growing pile of bodies, even the music, however beautiful, refuses to help...The rumors are true, this film does, in fact, literally kill you. ***"

Tokyo Story,1953,Yasujirō Ozu, ★★★★★ ," Tokyo Story marks the first time in what feels like months that a movie has affected me in such a profound and personal way. Filled to the brim with muted heartbreaks, this film perfectlyportrays the unavoidable chasms that form within a family unit, and Ozu portrays this in such a natural, non-judgmental, and minimalist way it’s simply heartbreaking.

Ozu is fantastic at directing things and should be applauded for the way that he directs things. He's just very good at directing things that's all I'm saying. Tokyo Story is a punch to the gut if you have family that you haven't honored as much as they deserve which is something that is probably true for most of us. The themes are timeless, the performances are heartening and the script is a real killer. That's all I've got... it's just a really beautiful film. Yes. ***"

Tokyo Story,1953,Yasujirō Ozu, ★★★★★ ," Definitely one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen.Tokyo Story reflects on such universal themes as family, aging, economic hardship, the working class and war-torn families in an incredibly fascinating way.The film is shot through static shots in which the people within them interact, giving the feeling of life as a grouping of moments. The main couple is probably one of the most beautiful and pure in cinema. ***"

The Passion of Joan of Arc,1928,Carl Theodor Dreyer, ★★★★½ ," This film is revolutionary for a reason.Every frame, cut, camera move, and closeup felt perfectly executed. Maria Falconetti was flawless in her portray of the stoic, courageous, and silently expressive Joan of Arc. I didn’t really think this film would interest me, but I was incredibly wrong. The film itself feels holy, as if I’m watching b roll of religious statues reenacting this pivotal moment in history. I wish I had more organized thoughts to express my admiration for The Passion of the Joan of Arc, but at least I can this: I’m extremely happy I watched this film. 9.3 / 10 ***"

The Passion of Joan of Arc,1928,Carl Theodor Dreyer, ★★★★★ ," Give a man a book about good and evil and he will use it as a tool to label every challenger as evil. All the while believing he is inherently good by virtue of holding the book.From the craft on display to the sensibilities within, The Passion of Joan of Arc feels wildly modern. I'll admit I have not seen much from the era, but some of the camera movements seem pretty advanced for a hand-crank rig? ***"

Great performances, insightful and deeeeeply sad and finally romantic, artfully staged and just a perfect script. The way it sets up and pays off elements like a broken compact mirror or the keys... folks, they don't make 'em like they used to. ***"

(Fran Kubelik)Hi everybody, I catched up this all time classic from 1960 and must say the reputation of the film is absolutely deserved even though I expected something else. Because after Billy Wilders huge success ""Some like it hot"" in 1959 he wanted to direct another comedy alongside Jack Lemmon and I honestly expected something like said one which is additionaly one of my favorite comedys. Instead this film is much more serious and the humor is much more subtle. ***"
The Apartment,1960,Billy Wilder, ★★★★★ ," I’m not on here much anymore, but geez.. every other review on here spends more time critiquing other movie fans rather than the movies themselves… or political ramblings and folks stomping their feet saying shit like “put the barrel of a gun in their mouths and squeeze the trigger till it goes click” all for not liking the same movie. You guys are wild lol… anyways, this movie is great—a total classic that I don’t revisit often… but when I do it still manages to feel even better than it did the time before.. Happy new year! ***"

Jack Lemmon plays the perfect lovable pushover. The plotting is to die for. Every turn the movie took had me hankering to find out where it was gonna go next. It’s a rare movie that simultaneously goes exactly where you want it to go but not where you expected. ***"

Woman in the Dunes,1964,Hiroshi Teshigahara, ★★★★★ ," 93/100Hasty airport catchup: Marveled while rewatching this at its allegorical versatility, or perhaps slipperiness—it feels like it could represent anything and everything, which I suppose detractors might argue means that it represents nothing. Ultimately doesn't matter much, though, as the film's weirdly parched sensuality knocks me for a loop right from the surface. Life is an inexorable invasion of grit, inspiring a sort of existential Stockholm Syndrome; had Teshigahara chosen to call this The Sand, its kinship with Sjoström's The Wind (a contender for my favorite silent feature; Woman in the Dunes might as well be one too) would be more apparent. ***"
Woman in the Dunes,1964,Hiroshi Teshigahara, ★★★★★ ," one of the most strikingly composed and meditative fables ever put to film. at once unnervingly surreal and stripped down to the essential, elemental reality of everyday existence. a film interested in both the pursuit of purpose and control within the exchange of labor/resources for food, sleep and sex but also the pure banality and beauty that can be found in the rhythms & routines of our violent, coercive exploitation after a certain amount of time, distance and acceptance. incredible film. no idea why i didn't watch this sooner. full discussion on ep 227 of my podcast SLEAZOIDS. ***"

Woman in the Dunes,1964,Hiroshi Teshigahara, ★★★★★ ," A retelling of The Myth of Sisyphus, adjusted to fit the mold of an allegory for modern society: an endless slope of repetitive tasks with no remarkable reward, all while the privileged (placed literally above the man and woman) observe coldly. To escape it is an almost impossible challenge, and even if you do you’re bound by to be shoved down the dunes again. A relentless, shockingly consistently unnerving psychological thriller/horror constantly exhibiting mastery of the craft with its absolutely mesmerizing craftsmanship and coverage. “Are you shoveling sand to live or living to shovel sand?” ***"
Woman in the Dunes,1964,Hiroshi Teshigahara, ★★★★★ ," Woman in the Dunes executed everything flawlessly. The complex character dynamic, incredible dialogue. The black & white cinematography and score adds on to the uncomfortable claustrophobic atmosphere of this hellish hole. We feel the sand's presence around us. It feels as if you’re in the dunes with them, nonstop agony. The sand is one giant metaphor for our existence. We can’t decide how we want to live our lives. ***"

It’s an engaging tale of claustrophobia, adaptability, and survival. Cinematography is beautifully detailed from sand, skin, insects, underground mountains, water and the sand on top of skin. Huge props to Teshigahara’s directing because he makes harmless normal sand to look so terrifying. It was a little slow at times, but it was never boring. Without saying much, it’s a really good movie! ***"

Cinema Paradiso,1988,Giuseppe Tornatore, ★★★★★ ," I can’t get over this. I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to say that this is a perfectly executed film. A beautiful story about friendship, childhood and cinema. I don’t even know what to say other than it managed to connect with every emotion and that this film is any film lovers dream. THIS IS CINEMA. ***"
Cinema Paradiso,1988,Giuseppe Tornatore, ★★★★★ ," All Time FavouritesA film not only about loving movies, but simply about love. About remembering it, cherishing it, pursuing it, abandoning it, forgetting it and retrieving it. Oozing with affection and delight, it is a wonderful memoir to nostalgia and childhood. Containing one of the greatest scores and endings of all time, it is, quite simply, one of the greatest films ever made. ***"

Autumn Sonata,1978,Ingmar Bergman, ★★★★½ ," Exhausting. Autumn Sonata wears you down slowly, fooling you with its apparent tranquility, and then bumping into you with flooding violence. Autumn Sonata grows slowly, starting calmly, quietly, a chamber piece, building towards a blasting climax, a continuous flow of words, of years of hate and despise and incommunicability, destined to failure. The structure is a perfect circle. As the movie begin, it ends, as some things, some hateful memories, some unknown feelings are better to be left alone, in a dark oblivion. ***"

Autumn Sonata,1978,Ingmar Bergman, ★★★★★ , “Are the daughter's miseries the mother's triumphs?”Ingmar Bergman knew something about life and the human condition that the rest of us will never know. Some of the greatest performances of all time. A film that attacks your soul and never lets go. ***
Autumn Sonata,1978,Ingmar Bergman, ★★★★½ ," Two of Bergman’s best character studies and probably the best performance I’ve seen in a Bergman film hands down (Liv Ullmann).Paced perfectly, it would feel wrong to label the raw and deeply personal Autumn Sonata anything less than one of Bergman’s most important works. 9.4 / 10 ***"

Autumn Sonata,1978,Ingmar Bergman, ★★★★★ ," Wow, even better than I remembered. So utterly brutal, just like Scene From a Marriage. Liv and Ingrid toe to toe in an epic battle of out of this world acting skills. Watch something like Cries and Whispers and see how Liv is cruel and seductive, then to Autumn Sonata where she spends so much of it meek and passive. Watch Gaslight to see Ingrid vulnerable to this, where she is cold and callus. Just two utterly outstanding performances. ***"
Autumn Sonata,1978,Ingmar Bergman, ★★★★★ ," Potent, enduring opera of dysfunctional relationships and repressed emotions. A ruthless canvas of time lost and time wasted, the selfishness of individualism, with seemingly inviting territory but in reality, an internal nightmare filled with suffering and abandon. Beginning to realise Bergman writes dialogue like no other. Autumn Sonata? More like Autumn So-Masterpiece ***"

Andrei Rublev,1966,Andrei Tarkovsky, ★★★★★ ," Holy fuck, watching this in a theatre was one of, if not the, best cinematic experiences I’ve ever had. Blown away once again. Perfection. ***"
Andrei Rublev,1966,Andrei Tarkovsky, ★★★★★ ," Tarkovsky's expanses here are breathtaking in their cold beauty and atmospheric horror, and his massacre sequence is wildly mounted. The terror of nature and the man-made world force confrontation with superficial, cloistered faith, which subsequently reshaped and, ultimately, reaffirmed by confrontation. In an odd way it's a reminder that true faith was accelerating the contradictions well before Karl Marx suggested it as a bedrock of communism. The glory of God is not omnipresent, it must be rigorously sought out, and constantly subject to revision. ***"
Andrei Rublev,1966,Andrei Tarkovsky, ★★★★★ ," “—True to your art, so to say?”“—True to… yes, that’s like saying a man’s true to his cancer.”Faith falters in the face of sin:In art, in God, in man.Fighting to keep your fire burningBeside wounded birds alight.Full review here ***"
Andrei Rublev,1966,Andrei Tarkovsky, ★★★★★ ," Probably greatest motion picture ever made, plain and simple. Every inch of film is full of life and vitality. Each frame is incredibly poetic and immaculately composed, rich with symbolism in every corner and crevice. After four watches, I can safely state that there has never been anything as grandiose nor beautifully and honestly human as Andrei Rublev.Through the vehicle of cinema, we can achieve divine transcendence.Head over to Edgar’s review for an outstanding in-depth analysis and breakdown of this perfect work. ***"

Andrei Rublev,1966,Andrei Tarkovsky, ★★★★½ ," Yet another Tarkovsky masterpiece that focuses on the role of the artist in a increasingly violent, cynical, secular, and uninterested world. Some of the best cinematography I’ve seen, a deeply philosophical and emotional script coupled with amazing performances truly makes this a transformative film. I think sometimes the 3 hour run time really messes with the film a little bit though, and I wish the basic plot was a little easier to follow (lots of characters and easy to miss exposition), but all in all an amazing film.9.3 / 10 ***"
Andrei Rublev,1966,Andrei Tarkovsky, None , Seeing Andrei Tarkovsky introducing his father’s masterpiece in my native language was something I’ll never forget.Everything is an eternal circle and it repeats and repeats itself.(Director’s cut) ***
Andrei Rublev,1966,Andrei Tarkovsky, ★★★★ ," My third Tarkovsky film and it's *still* a film I appreciate a lot more than I love.This is a packed film. Filled to the brim with a lot of truths and a lot of conflict about religion, history and art. An ambitious story that's clearly very personal to Tarkovsky. And once again, it's brought to life spectacularly. Swooping wide shots, every angle beautifully composed, getting into the nitty and gritty of all the conflicts that Rublev lived through. A thoroughly beautiful production.Unfortunately, it just didn't work that well for me. I really wanted it to, but it didn't. A wonderful production nonetheless. ***"
Andrei Rublev,1966,Andrei Tarkovsky, ★★★★★ ," The 30-minute ""The Bell"" episode by itself merits a five star rating. This is my first viewing of Andrei Rublev, in fact my first Tarkovsky film (yes, shame on me!), and here I was expecting just another biographical epic. An epic it is indeed, but not like anything I have ever seen before or likely to see in the future. The ending is just…wow. ***"
Andrei Rublev,1966,Andrei Tarkovsky, ★★★★ ," Third Sunday of AdventStir up your power, O Lord, and with great might come among us; and, because we are sorely hindered by our sins, let your bountiful grace and mercy speedily help and deliver us; through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom, with you and the Holy Ghost, be honor and glory, now and for ever. Amen. ***"
Andrei Rublev,1966,Andrei Tarkovsky, ★★★★★ ," Wow.. Simply breathtaking, heartbreaking.. An elergy to mankind, and a judgment. There are scenes here, that transcend cinema, and are on an ethereal plain of their own. Truly, a haunting piece. The last few scenes..an inferno of electricity; out-worldly.. A hypnotic odysseyAn overwhelming mosaic.. ***"
Andrei Rublev,1966,Andrei Tarkovsky, None ," Sometimes I struggle even just to see this work as ""significant"" and ""influential."" I know I am a colossal philistine but Tarkovsky is just not my bag. Too ponderous and medieval and self-important. But the crucial thing here is, history does not give a shit what I think, and I know better than to think everyone else is somehow wrong. There is a Tarkovsky-shaped hole in my soul and one day maybe said cavity will be filled with the appropriate depth and experience. ***"
Andrei Rublev,1966,Andrei Tarkovsky, ★★★★★ , Tarkosvky's best work.Deciding to rewatch the movie this time while I actually have another movie that I wanna watch is one of the best decisions I've ever made. ***

Andrei Rublev,1966,Andrei Tarkovsky, ★★★ ," Oh this was a bit disappointing. It had me for a while. I liked the story, the main guy, the score, the fat snowflakes, the skinny horses, the eerie witches chanting scene and it looked just as beautiful as Ivan's Childhood. But little by little it began to lose me and when it got past the 2 hours mark I did the thing I just despise to do with films and I took a half an hour break. When I got back to it I was just so blase about it up until those final wonderful minutes where I was transfixed. ***"
Andrei Rublev,1966,Andrei Tarkovsky, ★★★★★ ," It's been 6 weeks since I watched this and I'm still thinking about it. What an amazing event Rublev is. Stunning film-craft.Tarkovsky, you are a genius.Upgrade granted: 10/10. ***"

Paris, Texas is a deeply moving, intimate & subversive western, one of my all-time favorite movies. Harry Dean Stanton was brilliant in just about everything but Paris, Texas is probably my favorite performance of his. The photography is absolutely beautiful. Dripping with vivid colors and creating such depth within even the simplest images, absolute genius work by Robby Müller. The final scene between Stanton and Kinski in the club separated by a one-way mirror is one of the best ever displays of filmmaking & characterisation through imagery.An unforgetabble piece of american cinema.  ***"

Memories of Murder,2003,Bong Joon-ho, ★★★★★ ," How do you catch a killer when you have zero leads, zero eye witnesses, and no trace of evidence at all? By using your feet. Memories of Murder left a knot in my stomach, and a bitter sensation in my tongue that would linger there for decades to come. I mean that as a compliment. I only know a handful of films which had affected me in this way. ***"
Memories of Murder,2003,Bong Joon-ho, ★★★★★ , I don't know much about rural South Korea but it seems like there was a lot of women walking through the woods alone during one of the most vicious cases of serial rape/killings. ***

Le Trou,1960,Jacques Becker, ★★★★½ , It's nice that they hired only deaf prison guards ***
Le Trou,1960,Jacques Becker, ★★★★★ ," -3 times more engrossing than Stalag 17 (1953).-1.5 times more detailed and elaborate than The Great Escape (1963).-5 times more suspenseful than Escape from Alcatraz (1979).-20 times more fascinating than The Shawshank Redemption (1994).Becker's farewell is a fascinating thrill ride full of emotions and unexpected twists (or at least they would be unexpected if people hadn't seen many similar films before this one). This is an absolute must, and one of the finest in the ""prison escape"" genre.98/100 ***"
Le Trou,1960,Jacques Becker, ★★★★★ , Nothing more cinematic than digging a hole.An all-time great final line. ***
Le Trou,1960,Jacques Becker, ★★★★★ , i really couldve watched those dudes hammer away at cement for hours ***

Le Trou,1960,Jacques Becker, ★★★★★ ," ""Pauvre Gaspard!""Still the greatest french movie ever made and one of my all time favorites. ***"
Le Trou,1960,Jacques Becker, ★★★★½ ," Why is that claustrophobia is deeply connected with some of the most unforgettable thrillers of all time? Coincidentally they all are French; Wages of Fear,A Man Escaped,Rififi,Les Diaboliques and now Le Trou.Becker subverts the cliches we normally see and creates palpable tension in each and every frame.Tightly constructed this overlooked gem makes even the most mundane activities look arresting.MUST WATCH!P.S - Two of the inmates resemble Daniel Auteuil and Anthony Quinn :-) ***"
Le Trou,1960,Jacques Becker, ★★★★½ , me: do you mind if i put on some white noise to help me get to sleep?*puts on le trou* ***
Le Trou,1960,Jacques Becker, ★★★★½ ," Five years after Jules Dassin's 30+ minute silent jewel heist sequence in the film Rififi and four years after Robert Bresson meticulously mapped the escape of a French Resistance fighter from a WWII prison in A Man Escaped, Jacques Becker made a film with the character interaction of the former and the dedication to the details of prison break mechanics of the latter, continuing a French filmic convention of men silently working against incredible odds in almost real time to change their lot in life (a list which would also include The Wages of Fear). It's a shame this is so under seen. ***"
Le Trou,1960,Jacques Becker, ★★★★★ ," I’m a broken mess after that ending, been sitting here in silence for 15 minutes and can’t wrap my head around it. In awe of Jacques Becker’s directorial style; gritty cinematography, shot composition and minimalistic approach. Sensational prison drama, the best. ***"
Le Trou,1960,Jacques Becker, ★★★★★ ," “poor gaspard” perfect movies do exist! the long takes were hypnotic, the characters were distinctly compelling, the hole-digging was asmr. loyalty + brotherhood, violation after violation + the taste of freedom, class + prison abolition... there is so much to unpack that even after discussing it for hours after the credits rolled there’s still more to say. nothing like showing this movie to someone for the first time (‘: ***"

Le Trou,1960,Jacques Becker, ★★★★½ ," Ever watched a film that feels like you've been punched right in the gut? All the energy sapped out of you because you seemingly forgot to breathe? This is one of those films. The build up of tension in every sequence, the ingenuity of the characters, their camaraderie and their humanity. Simply wonderful to view.It's a little bittersweet knowing Becker died only a short while after the completion of Le Trou.He left us with an absolute masterpiece. ***"
Le Trou,1960,Jacques Becker, ★★★★★ ," Fucking riveting film that flawlessly depicts the process of escaping prison by digging out. It is crazy tight, crazy tense, crazy detailed. There are many moments where you're just watching these men clang metal against cement as it cracks and breaks and forms the titular ""hole"" and it just hypnotizes you with blissful procedure. The ending raised my neck hairs a bit too. This has become my new gold standard to judge all prison films by. ***"
Le Trou,1960,Jacques Becker, ★★★★★ ," #RamadhanDay21This film remains one of the best prison thrillers in existence. Its gripping, unrelenting adn consistently engrossing, and is aware of the richness and depth little details can bring to the entire experience ***"
Le Trou,1960,Jacques Becker, ★★★★½ ," Can’t go wrong with a classic prison escape movie. The tension is so palpable in this movie, and the camaraderie between the characters is fantastic. It’s not a perfectly paced film but there were many times where I just couldn’t take my eyes off the screen. It’s one of those movies where you realize you’ve been holding your breath for the past 5 minutes when a sequence ends. And that ending…damn. ***"

Trapped inside, I was forced to follow her downward spiral, my mind slowly decaying with hers. Satoshi Kon, you evil bastard. You... genius. Blurring the line between reality and imagination with each cut, always have us guessing what will assault our eyes in the next scene, building up an unsettling amount of tension with such rapid pace.

Do the Right Thing,1989,Spike Lee, ★★★★★ ," 100 Endless, boundary-breaking space - Lee creates moments that seem to spread out over an imaginary audience, the characters expressing in theatrical quips and soliloquies for a watchful crowd, but then the camera will track back or rush in for a close up, and the street extends further and further, the setting sun marking its doom.

Biopics don't have any style? This movie has Schrader juggling four or five different styles, all with their own thematic purposes and their own interconnected threads. Add in Philip Glass' rapturous, beautiful score, a certain hall of famer, and you're getting close to masterpiece territory. I was at the screening where Lars said ""ironic beheadings"" too. ***"

Fanny and Alexander,1982,Ingmar Bergman, ★★★★★ ," Bergman takes a language, family, place not our own, and within one hour, makes them feel like home. The next two hours are spent ripping that home away from us, with malice and confusion. “Fanny and Alexander” is a beautiful ode to childhood fantasy, but also imbues the viewer with secondhand trauma of such cruelty, that it feels as if it will linger for the rest of time. ***"

The last one being a TV show by the name of The Haunting of Hill House, maybe you've heard of it. Well, it shouldn't be a surprise that legendary director Ingmar Bergman would be the one to break that losing streak.In case you're wondering it has been 606 actual films since my last masterpiece rating of 5 stars (Lucky) 100/100, or 100%. Bae, I am knocking them down! Only God, the puppeteer, will stop me now. ***"
Fanny and Alexander,1982,Ingmar Bergman, ★★★★ ," Epic Bergman. I watched the 'short' 3 hour version as opposed to the 5 hour TV Miniseries. Not Bergman's best, but a must for any cinephile. Neither of the titular characters really feature in the first hour, which is just character building and scene setting, it's the final 90 minutes that really packs the punch with the usual Bergman sub themes of guilt, grief, conflict playing major roles. The segment where the children realise the horror of being kept in a nightmarish abusive home is brilliant directing. A great Christmas film.7.8/10 ***"
Fanny and Alexander,1982,Ingmar Bergman, ★★ , Bergmans panoptical autobiographical family tale is - instead of a squaring of his oevre - an endless stream of narration with few imprinting images and an odd absence of Bergmans typical depiction of the human soul. too many figures spoil the broth. an excessive late work without the concentrated essence of his best pieces. ***
Barry Lyndon,1975,Stanley Kubrick, ★★★★★ ," Showed this to my mom today. She thinks 2001: A Space Odyssey is the most boring film of all time, she walked out of A Clockwork Orange and she never ceases to complain about every aspect in Dr. Strangelove.....And yet, she was utterly entranced for every second of Barry Lyndon, laughing and crying along with the ravishing imagery and the remarkable storytelling. Ladies and gentlemen, there's a Stanley Kubrick film for everyone. ***"
Barry Lyndon,1975,Stanley Kubrick, ★★★★★ ," Long movies scare me. Period pieces scare me. They are both things that I historically (haha get it because period piece) have not exactly found EASY to watch. They’re usually GREAT, but impatient people like myself have a hard time getting the energy to watch things like that. But I gotta say, despite that, I loved every second of Barry Lyndon. ***"

Barry Lyndon,1975,Stanley Kubrick, ★★★★★ ," I maintain now and always that this is one of the great comedies, a slow burn of greed, cowardice and arrogance that depicts an aristocratic structure that creates arbitrary divisions among European nations united in the absurdity of their power hierarchies. The film suggests that the entire aristocracy of Europe is maintained by interbred families and brazen confidence tricks perpetuated by both pretenders and genuine members of the ruling class. Watching this, it's a wonder how WWI took as long as it did to break out. That it is one of the most rapturously photographed films ever made is almost a mere bonus. ***"

An altogether fun, enjoyable and immensely beautiful experience. An accurate aesthetic, a pitch perfect score, wonderful narration and the best performance of Ryan O'Neal's career contribute to making this an unforgettable masterpiece. ***"

Once Upon a Time in the West,1968,Sergio Leone, ★★½ ," Best music and camera work ever for a really long and dull movie. Critics saying this film is a deconstruction of the western genre and give it a pass for having a weak story does the not fly with me. The revealing of who harmonica is was interesting, but that is only followed by an anti-climatic shoot out. Viewers deserve more after watching this go on for so long. The scene where the one side character was sneaking around the train was ok. Glad I watched it, but I think I would have rather seen 'For a Few Dollar More' again instead. ***"

Once Upon a Time in the West,1968,Sergio Leone, ★★★★★ ," It was on television so I couldn't resist watching the whole thing. Such a simple and slow-paced, yet operatic, meaningful, beautiful and thrilling tale of revenge, the end of the old west and the conquering of the american frontier. The ultimate western. Has the most beautiful score of all time. Epic and unforgettable scenes throughout. There's not much dialogue, but every word spoken is just gold. It is the film that sparkled my love for cinema, and therefore it will always have a big place in my heart if not the most important. Just pure brilliance. GOOSEBUMPS ***"
Once Upon a Time in the West,1968,Sergio Leone, ★★★★★ ," Simply masterful. As impeccably crafted as Leone's other western masterpiece, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, but to an altogether different effect.I'm amazed by how fast time passes in this nearly 3-hour epic. The way in which Leone (and Morricone) stretch and pull time for meditative tension reaches impossibly transcendent heights by the film's bittersweet conclusion. ***"
Once Upon a Time in the West,1968,Sergio Leone, ★★★★½ ," I don't know how one film can contain so much suspense. I know people say that Hitchcock is the king of suspense but my god Leone knew how to keep you on the edge of your seat. Except for maybe The Good, The Bad and The Ugly and The Godfather, I couldn't tell you a film that has more performances that are as cool as the ones in this. Henry Fonda and Charles Bronson are just some of the most badass actors we've ever seen. ***"
Once Upon a Time in the West,1968,Sergio Leone, ★★★★½ ," Jesus fucking christLeone wants to rework what he percieves as black-and-white moralisms of his influences - which only shows that he didn't understand them in the first place, or rather that he only saw them in terms of iconography.

The Human Condition II: Road to Eternity,1959,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★★ ," Masaki Kobayashi is a genius and The Human Condition trilogy should be talked about more. This is masterful filmmaking. These movies could be boring as they’re over 3 hours long, and it’s not a war movie American audiences are used to. There’s little action and it’s all about the moral quandary Kaji has between duty and family. Incredible performances, fantastic camera work, and an unquestionably brilliant script. I can’t wait to see the third one! ***"

The Human Condition II: Road to Eternity,1959,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★★ ," The second part of The Human Condition, Road To Eternity sees Kaji's persevering pacificism tested further, as his anti-military and humanist values conflict with the direct impact his actions now have on his fellow soldiers. Masaki Kobayashi's direction feels even more fluid here, with a tighter plot that focuses on fleshing out the characterisation of Kaji. And in doing so, the acting of Tatsuya Nakadai evolves into utter brilliance. If the final part is anywhere near his level here, which I can only presume it will be, then Nakadai's performance might become one of my all-time favourites. ***"
The Human Condition II: Road to Eternity,1959,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★★ ," The sheer brilliance of our main character’s development with the first two films has been an adventure. A relentlessly cruel film series even by war movie standards. Cinematographer Yoshio Miyaajima continues to impress me with his unique capability of capturing the grand scale of what our characters are experiencing in harsh environments. Even with the long runtime, the pacing outweighs the runtime. The fantastic dialogue to raw performances and phenomenal black-and-white cinematography just like the first film makes for amazing cinema. ***"

The Human Condition II: Road to Eternity,1959,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★ ," AThere's too much slapping going on in this film (take a shot everytime a character slaps another character). I guess it's probably one of the reasons why this second part of Kobayashi's 9-hour anti-war epic SLAPS lol. Tho unlike the first film, I felt the runtime with this one even though it's the shortest in the trilogy. Nonetheless, there's still plenty to love here -- the exquisite filmmaking, strong storytelling, and Kaji, who is seriously one of the best cinematic characters ever. Now onto the final one! ***"

Critically, I have to say that this wasnt really doing anything special for a good 2 hours, but the final act was masterful in it's use of lighting, composition, acting, blocking and pacing. Looking forward to some emotional payoff in the final film, because I haven't found too much in terms of personal connection just quite yet. I can see this being bumped to a 3 if the ending here isn't made use of. ***"

It's a Wonderful Life,1946,Frank Capra, ★★★★½ ," It's a testament to this film that I have seen it at least once for every year I've been alive, and I still cry during it. There's something about someone's small contributions to this world being recognized by everyone around him that crushes me; I just want everyone around me to know how much they mean to me. I want you all to know what you've done for me. That moment makes me feel like part of the crowd, cheering George Bailey on, wishing him a Merry Christmas, giving what little I can to help keep him alive. ***"

The Cranes Are Flying,1957,Mikhail Kalatozov, ★★★★½ ," Fucking hell, is every Russian just born with an incredible, unique ability to create the most stunning imagery?? ***"
The Cranes Are Flying,1957,Mikhail Kalatozov, ★★★★★ , If you've watched a more beautiful B&W film than this then consider yourself very lucky. The cinematography in The Cranes Are Flying is the heart and soul of the movie but it'd also be unfair to not acknowledge the timeless and moving love story it captures along with Tatiana Samoilova great performance. This really should be on the syllabus of all film classes. ***
The Cranes Are Flying,1957,Mikhail Kalatozov, ★★★★★ ," ***One of the best 150 films I have ever seen.***Flawless war masterpiece, mostly captivating and heartbreaking, but honest drama about a doomed romance set in war times.

The Cranes Are Flying,1957,Mikhail Kalatozov, ★★★★★ , Not nearly enough people have seen this masterpiece. There are sequences from this film that continue to replay in my head. The direction is honestly flawless here. Every shot has a purpose and tells a story. The screenplay at a certain point grips you and never lets you go. The acting is astounding and our two leads have such great chemistry. Everything from the production design to the score is perfect. This is one of the best movies I’ve seen so please check it out. ***
The Cranes Are Flying,1957,Mikhail Kalatozov, ★★★★★ ," Audrey Hepburn, is that you? ***"
The Cranes Are Flying,1957,Mikhail Kalatozov, ★★★½ ," Not the masterpiece I expected but still a very pleasant film. Especially visually it has aged like fine wine, very well shot for its time with lots of camerawork and beautiful use of light and shadow. That being said, the drama is heartbreaking and melancholic, but still, a bit too simple for my taste, it tends to be a bit theatrical at times. Like I said before, visually strong, but not consistent. The soundtrack is also a big let down for me. Anyway, it might sound negative, it doesn’t matter much. Fortunately, this film has plenty to offer further. ***"

The Cranes Are Flying,1957,Mikhail Kalatozov, ★★★★ , i dont care what you think of the soviet union u must admit that their movies fucking ruled ***
The Cranes Are Flying,1957,Mikhail Kalatozov, ★★★★ ," This is one of those movies that’s just so well made that I don’t even know what to say about it. The story we follow is really tragic at times but it’s hard to look away when the visuals are so stunning. Veronika’s story is a deeply sad one, as most stories about war tend to be. Tatyana Samoylova plays her wonderfully and is insanely talented. There were moments where I was very unsure of how to feel about this story but I think the ending was very strong and cathartic. I’m glad I saw this, it’s definitely a branch out from my normal taste. ***"
The Cranes Are Flying,1957,Mikhail Kalatozov, ★★★★★ , this is more or less as formally exceptional as I Am Cuba (although perhaps not as grandiose in scale) but i think i might prefer it a smidgen more just because i feel way more emotionally drawn to sort of genre of movie… Tatyana Samoylova is just incredible and her gaze is so piercing ***
The Cranes Are Flying,1957,Mikhail Kalatozov, ★★★½ , A wonderful display of love and betrayal during war. Some real chilly imagery in this bad boy. ***
The Cranes Are Flying,1957,Mikhail Kalatozov, ★★★★½ ," An amazing war film depicting the horrible outcomes and consequences from it. Also one of the best shots ever. Not only does it delve into these war concepts, it also dives into unwanted love and huge heaps of sadness. Like I said about the spectacular shot, this film is shot unlike any other. All around, this film is definitely one of the best shot films I’ve ever seen. ***"
The Cranes Are Flying,1957,Mikhail Kalatozov, ★★★★ , well this one hurt. don't watch unless you want your heart ripped out of your chest. ***
The Cranes Are Flying,1957,Mikhail Kalatozov, ★★★½ ," I would start my own war if someone tried to make me leave Tatyana Samoylova...Heartbreaking romance set against the backdrop of WWII, with more miscommunication than an episode of ""Three's Company"". Pretty melodramatic, but only enough to make you really good and invested. Today, this would be full of swelling scores and scenes of un-earned pathos. In 1957 , a close-up of Veronika's trembling and tear-swollen eyes was all you needed. ***"

A Separation,2011,Asghar Farhadi, ★★★★★ ," One of Asghar Farhadi’s finest piece of work that’s truly a classic masterpiece in Iranian cinema. His mastery over his writing and craftsmanship is in full display here. The way he explores the human psyche with his morally ambiguous situations, leaves you awestruck with an unparalleled emotionally rewarding experience. The movie has no music, but it’s so intense and absorbing, that it hardly makes you notice it. A highly recommended watch. ***"
A Separation,2011,Asghar Farhadi, ★★★★★ ," A movie that keeps expanding. A gradual unfolding of complex relationships, ethical dilemmas, and human emotions. It’s like one of those compressed wipes that blossom when you drop them in water. Or tears. ***"
A Separation,2011,Asghar Farhadi, ★★★★½ ," Ashgar Farhadi’s A Separation is an utterly brilliant examination of marital dynamics and class struggles all set behind the backdrop of an enthralling legal drama. It’s a true masterclass in using restraint as further means to build suspense; a film that, through all the morally complex dilemmas and expertly staged moments of drama, shows there’s no need for intricate non-linear storytelling or bombastic set pieces to heighten an enthralling narrative. All you really need is an expertly conceived screenplay with stakes that audiences can deeply connect with and Farhadi nails that with ease here. What a film! ***"

A Separation,2011,Asghar Farhadi, ★★★★ ," If someone could show me the way to the moral highway, I'd dearly appreciate it. Pretty much my perfect kind of movie, all dialogue, no flashy editing or cinematography, just down to earth human storytelling. A perfect double feature along with Mads Mikkelsen's The Hunt ***"
A Separation,2011,Asghar Farhadi, ★★★★½ ," Domestic dramas don't get much more insightful, nuanced, or gripping than this. Canny withholding of information from the audience underlines the themes and creates a surprising amount of suspense. Every character is shaded and sympathetic to some degree. One of the tightest, most insightful screenplays I've encountered in a long time. Increasingly complex without becoming convoluted or contrived. ***"

A Separation,2011,Asghar Farhadi, ★★★★½ ," Brilliantly constructed and conceived story about nobody doing the right thing.

This film does it in an exquisite way, simple yet very effective. This was my first ever Iranian movie and I’m looking forward to discover some more because sometimes I think that people (myself included) forget that other than Hollywood there is a lot more out there. Side note: the ending broke me ***"
A Separation,2011,Asghar Farhadi, ★★★★★ ," Brilliantly written, notably in how it perfectly sets itself up to be largely centered on the conflict between Simin and Nader, only to make the bold choice of setting that aside for a large portion of the film and instead focus on other aspects of Nader’s life (i.e., his father battling Alzheimer’s, the conflict that comes up between him and Razieh...), and then extends that into exploring modern Iranian culture as a whole, and how all of that ultimately ends up affecting the relationship between Simin, Nader, and their daughter Termeh. Top notch direction and performances, and what a hell of an ending. ***"

Never have I been so immediately swept up into an animated world and found myself so delighted by its beauty, horrified by its truths, and surprised by its richness. Filled with lovingly detailed designs and textures and complexities hidden within what initially appeared to be a basic story – there was seriously no character or theme in this film without fascinating nuances to explore. Truly a masterwork. ***"

The Red Shoes,1948,Emeric Pressburger, ★★★★★ ," A ravishing, delicate, painterly, expressionistic, and immaculately sustained work of dreamy poetry and magical flourishes; The Red Shoes is simply one of the great films of all time. Stunning doesn't even begin to describe it. The central ballet sequence is simultaneously one of the scariest and most heartbreaking stretches of cinema ever crafted. To watch it is to have your soul carried as high as cinema can take you. Trust me, take the ride. ***"

The Red Shoes,1948,Emeric Pressburger, ★★★★★ ," Not only is this the CITIZEN KANE of ballet movies, but it might just be the CITIZEN KANE of ALL color films, or perhaps CITIZEN KANE is THE RED SHOES of newspaper-tycoon movies. Whatever the permutation, it's always dazzling, brilliant, hilarious, heartbreaking. Perfect. ***"
The Battle of Algiers,1966,Gillo Pontecorvo, ★★★★★ ," Ashamed to say this was my first viewing. A very great movie, absolutely scorching. I like how this is unquestionably an anti-colonial, pro-Algerian movie that also has the stones the show the righteous side bombing public places and leaving dozens of ordinary people dead. It shows us these images without larding them up with disingenuous moralizing about how they’ve Gone Too Far, or reassuring us that This Is Actually Good. It just is. This is a world of violence. ***"
The Battle of Algiers,1966,Gillo Pontecorvo, ★★★★★ , Quite possibly the most electrifying — and influential — political thriller/war movie ever made. ***
The Battle of Algiers,1966,Gillo Pontecorvo, ★★★★½ ," 88Fell hook, line, and sinker for this as soon as Morricone's propulsive magic started to flare out of the soundtrack, but even on its own, this is a hell of a film, one which I can't really contextualize past its very own overdose of precedence. A corridor thriller intermingled with an angry, sinister conflict of perspective. Reminded me of Jason Bourne blockbusters or Billy Friedkin joints, only sharper. ***"
The Battle of Algiers,1966,Gillo Pontecorvo, ★★★★★ ," For a film full of specifics, perhaps one of the most timeless films ever made. ***"
The Battle of Algiers,1966,Gillo Pontecorvo, ★★★★ ," It’s not a matter of good or evil, but simply one of independence or oppression, sovereignty or subjugation, freedom or tyranny. Revolution is the muffled cry of the many, and it may not be heard at first, but it is tireless, dire, imperative. Nothing blooms where no seed is sown. ***"
The Battle of Algiers,1966,Gillo Pontecorvo, ★★★★★ ," It's sobering to read most contemporary reviewers stroke their chin as they pontificate, ""What a triumph of seeing the humanity of both sides of the conflict!"" and it's like, yea, the movie shows the cost of innocent lives in a brutal war, but let us not forget, one side is fucking colonialist scum. Get them the hell out! ***"
The Battle of Algiers,1966,Gillo Pontecorvo, ★★★★ ," Brutal, gritty, powerful and political The Battle of Algiers is quite an epic film for 1966.The documentary/newsreels style of filming only makes everything feel more urgent and in your face. The score by Morricone and Pontecorvo oddly, but like in the best way possible, remindes me of the ""Punch Drunk Love"" score and is just as successful in making me anxious.I would probably consider this essential viewing. ***"
The Battle of Algiers,1966,Gillo Pontecorvo, ★★★★ ," Compellingly told from both sides and impeccably photographed. Feels like a documentary in the sense that we understand and maybe even empathize with both the French and Algerians, making their escalating violence against one another increasingly upsetting. Fascinating how the camera is able to silently convey the tremendous human cost of a revolution, but even more impressively its grave importance and unstoppable momentum. ***"
The Battle of Algiers,1966,Gillo Pontecorvo, ★★★★½ ," ""It's hard to start a revolution. Even harder to continue it. And hardest of all to win it. But, it's only afterwards, when we have won, that the true difficulties begin."" It was truly both a heartbreaking an inspiring film.  I didn’t know much about this part of history going into it, but I thought it was well done, and I was fascinated by how honestly it portrayed the actions of both parties.it was especially amazing how actual algerian revolutionaries were cast in the film, many of whom are still alive today. ***"
The Battle of Algiers,1966,Gillo Pontecorvo, ★★★★★ , One of the best historical epics of all the time! ***
The Battle of Algiers,1966,Gillo Pontecorvo, ★★★★★ ," The casbah not as mere battleground but as a central character leading the revolution, the dense weave of labyrinthine alleys and stairways makes the city seem like an impenetrable wall, and the sheer verticality of the place allows algerians to tower over the french army, when a woman chants, the entire city echoes. Pontecorvo's sharp camera placement here really highlighted the beauty of algerian architecture. This is a film filled with vigour, power, ambition, made to document, inspire and overwhelm. The film can be both exhausting and exhilarating to sit through, but I feel as if I'm coming out of this emotional journey a different man. ***"
The Battle of Algiers,1966,Gillo Pontecorvo, ★★★★★ ," Hearing that one music cue for the first time in Inglourious Basterds, your first instinct is that it makes you feel ready to go out and fight Nazis.Hearing it again in Gillo Pontecorvo's The Battle of Algiers you're only setting yourself up for a mortifying war that feels like it's still going on even today. And everything you'll see here still remains as terrifying as it appeared in the 1960's.Films like this should be screened in history classes to get a better picture of what goes on in the world, and what we choose to ignore. ***"
The Battle of Algiers,1966,Gillo Pontecorvo, ★★★★½ , One of these days I’m going to create a list of every movie Tarantino has directly borrowed something from ***
The Battle of Algiers,1966,Gillo Pontecorvo, ★★★★★ ," 10/10My second watch. Once again, it's riveting, tragic, and empowering. With guerilla documentary style, it is loud, angry, and powerful in its portrayal of oppression in French Algiers. Brilliantly cut, excellently scored, and beautifully directed, it is a great film, and still one of the best cinema has to offer. ***"
The Battle of Algiers,1966,Gillo Pontecorvo, ★★★★★ , antifa is so cool ***
The Battle of Algiers,1966,Gillo Pontecorvo, ★★★★ ," A turbulent and ugly snapshot of history that still feels relevant over 60 years later. Bombings, torture, shootings, and demonstrations are unflinchingly recreated. It doesn't shy away from showing that it's mostly normal innocent people that are affected. However I can’t help but feel Its too biased towards the NLF and portrays the French as completely immoral - whilst lots of what they did was, it don’t think it compares to the terrorist attacks committed by the NLF, even with their intentions and motives in mind. ***"
The Battle of Algiers,1966,Gillo Pontecorvo, ★★★★★ ," Of all the films to snag a spot in the top 100 of the latest Sight & Sound poll — the BFI are currently screening them all, and I’m trying to catch those I haven’t seen — this strikes me as the most influential, or at least the one whose DNA has been passed on to the widest range of films. Not that that lessens any of the film’s power; this has got to be one of the most convincing and passionate films about revolution ever made. ***"
The Battle of Algiers,1966,Gillo Pontecorvo, ★★★★★ ," Magnificent in creating this atmosphere of unease that lays around every corner for the French colonial authorities, combined with a newsreel style and unknown cast of capable actors that gives the film an enveloping realism that makes the emotional highs that much more earned. ***"
The Battle of Algiers,1966,Gillo Pontecorvo, ★★★ ," A movie about the violent and passionate energies of revolution that are formed by pent up anxieties surrounding oppression, silence, injustice, colonizing, and established superiority over a people that only wish to exist, pushed so far by the system and the struggle that they can only fight back because it’s the only way they’ll be heard. Something oddly topical about that. ***"
The Battle of Algiers,1966,Gillo Pontecorvo, ★★★★ ," A sobering, brutally real depiction of revolutionary conflict. The film presents the actions as they are without adding any sentimentality or commentary. It's a great way to accomplish what the films sets out to accomplish, but I can't say I was always fully engaged. Important and radical filmmaking nonetheless. ×Criterion Challenge #12 - Genre: War×Top 250 Directors Challenge - 52/250 (#107 - Gillo Pontecorvo) ***"

The Thing,1982,John Carpenter, ★★★★½ , This was....a blast. Such a great time.Watched on unrestored 70mm in a packed and very sweaty theatre. Two minutes in I realized I was thirsty and thought to myself “I’ll find a dull moment to get up and go grab some water” but here’s the twist...there was no dull part. ***
The Thing,1982,John Carpenter, ★★★★★ , Among us: The movie ***
The Thing,1982,John Carpenter, ★★★★★ ,  Is that a man in there or something? Just gonna go ahead and pretend I saw this in theaters yesterday instead of sitting on my office chair watching it on my laptop ***
The Thing,1982,John Carpenter, None , So I actually think none of the guys got turned. I actually think some of those guys were just extremely random. ***
The Thing,1982,John Carpenter, ★★★★½ , This is the first time I've actually seen Wilford Brimley in something that isn't a YouTube Poop ***
The Thing,1982,John Carpenter, ★★★★½ , oh hey look it is the most nightmarish thing i have ever seen ***
The Thing,1982,John Carpenter, ★★★★ ," “you gotta be fucking kidding”the gnarliest practical special effects i’ve seen since alien. i’ll gladly take any amount of blood and gore on film any day of the week, but some of this shit made me gasp. SICK ***"
The Thing,1982,John Carpenter, ★★★★★ , would i trust kurt russell with my life? absolutelywould i trust kurt russell with my dog? not a chance in hell ***

The Thing,1982,John Carpenter, ★★★★★ ," ""I want to come back inside.""Everybody tuck your pants into your socks. ***"
The Thing,1982,John Carpenter, ★★★★★ ," Was reminded that I hadn't reviewed this here.This is not only a classic in the world of horror, but it remains to this day one of the finest examples of what the genre can achieve. Body horror, genuine tension, amazing practical effects, great cast, this a full package that everyone should experience at least once. ***"
The Thing,1982,John Carpenter, ★★★★½ ," “For as much as critics dismissed the film as expensive trash, there is an idea here: that fear and paranoia can dissolve the bonds of friendship, camaraderie and citizenship. That they can sap us of our ability to work together and paralyze us in the face of crisis. It is an idea which, in our age of misinformation, public distrust and pandemic disease, lands with heavy force.”From my, uh, New York Times take on the film. ***"
The Thing,1982,John Carpenter, ★★★★★ , you could pretty much name any movie The Thing ***
The Ascent,1977,Larisa Shepitko, None ," I had never heard of this film until reading James Schamus's top ten list on Criterion.com. A powerful film with incredible sequences. The opening five minutes has it all... exposition, beautiful reveals, dramatic framing and cutting and an opening title sequence that plays over a gun fight. Not sure I've ever seen that before. Sadly, director Larisa Shepitko passed at the age of 41 in a road accident. Imagine the classics she would have graced us with. I'm looking forward to watching her early film Krylya (Wings) which is also on the Criterion Channel. Won Berlin's Golden Bear in 1977.Watched on the Criterion Channel. ***"
The Ascent,1977,Larisa Shepitko, ★★★★★ , maybe the most devastatingly beautiful film I've ever seen ***
The Ascent,1977,Larisa Shepitko, ★★★★½ ," tremendous film, i cried the last 20 minutes because i was so overwhelmed with emotion. also, i did make a video about my trip to the theater to see this alongside come and see 🫣 ***"
The Ascent,1977,Larisa Shepitko, ★★★★½ ," The final moments in this incredible film are some of the most devastating i've ever experienced in a film, so full of self-hatred and soul-crushing personal torment that so deeply affected me. War is fucked up. Not sure what else to say, seek out this extremely powerful, grim and very human war film, or not if you don't want to feel completely miserable. ***"
The Ascent,1977,Larisa Shepitko, ★★★★ ," Larisa Shepitko's depiction of humanity in the grip of war left me shaken, a shell of my former self! Feeling weak my psyche spent, a truly humbling experience to witness a man Sotnikov (Boris Plotnikov) facing death and do so with such extraordinary grace, integrity and honor!The tight shots of Sotnikov's face with an almost christ like aura about him was as haunting as it was beautiful! ***"
The Ascent,1977,Larisa Shepitko, ★★★★★ ," beautiful and extremely hard to watch, with every glance into the camera i felt like my soul was getting ripped out of my body ***"
The Ascent,1977,Larisa Shepitko, ★★★★½ ," Set in the bleakest, wintriest landscape you'll ever see on film, The Ascent is full of panic and existential dread evoked by the impending doom, like adrenaline interjecting, adding pressurized gas to the inferno. This is what feels like to stare in the face of death. Larisa Shepitko has left behind one of the greatest films ever made, one that deals with the senseless brutality of war, stoicism, betrayal, and martyrdom - Either you live to die or die to live, you make your choice and suffer the consequences thereafter. Multiple viewings needed. ***"
The Ascent,1977,Larisa Shepitko, ★★★★★ ," Goes beyond words. The end is some of the rawest and wildest shit I have ever seen. This film is the bible. It starts one place and by the end, it has assaulted the viewer with its harrowing atmosphere and haunting camerawork that forever will be imprinted in my mind. Where it leaves the characters was the absolutely worst thing that could have happened to my sleep. ***"
The Ascent,1977,Larisa Shepitko, ★★★★ ," Luminous at hallucinatory pitch, delirious from cold, from illness, from pain, from hunger, what confirms and what distracts. Landscape of earth, what can be read there and in the faces of its inhabitants? Pushed to the isolate torment of collaboration or the crown of martyrdom, war is a stain, a scar upon the earth and upon the souls of those beings overtaken by war. Have snow-covered trees ever been so beautiful within a film? ***"
The Ascent,1977,Larisa Shepitko, ★★★★★ ," I need time to let this one sink, I'll watch it again soon when I feel like I'm ready. But I can comfortably say that this is one of the most harrowing war films that I've ever seen. ***"
The Ascent,1977,Larisa Shepitko, ★★★★½ , it's war movies like this and Paths of Glory (1957) that make me hate contemporary american/english war movies all the more. less heroic bullshit and more of that human condition 😋 ***
The Ascent,1977,Larisa Shepitko, ★★★★½ ," “I know what a human being really is. And you’ll find out too.”Don’t leave me in this infinite whiteness. Stare into my soul, I’m here. Save me or take me. Have mercy. ***"
The Ascent,1977,Larisa Shepitko, ★★★★★ ," truly one of the most gut-wrenching, soul-crushing movies i've ever experienced, and definitely one of the best war films i've ever seen. everything builds up masterfully to an extremely powerful third act that had me sobbing like a baby and full of anger at the same time... god this was a lotoh also there was a lot of gay subtext here it HAD to be intentional ***"
The Ascent,1977,Larisa Shepitko, ★★★★½ , I mean.... fuuuuuuuck. ***
The Ascent,1977,Larisa Shepitko, ★★★½ , fellas is it gay to blow your hot breath onto the back of your buddy’s neck to unfreeze his body from a tree so you can delena carry him to the warmth of a nearby hearth? ***
The Ascent,1977,Larisa Shepitko, ★★★★½ , Cold boy winter ***
The Ascent,1977,Larisa Shepitko, None ," the unbroken half-smile of one and eyes full of tears of another linked by an invisible but scalding bridge that, like a raw nerve, devotes itself wholly to the generational succession of the grand knowing. the scalp frozen to a tree of one and the soft breath of another, saving a few hairs on his head, not yet knowing this hair will be fluttering in the wind remarkably soon, the savior being the one making the last push ***"
The Ascent,1977,Larisa Shepitko, ★★★★½ ," Nothing brings out the worst in people quite as forcefully as being eye to eye with someone whose spirit cannot be broken. The Ascent is a portrait of a person like that, and it is fantastic. ***"
The Ascent,1977,Larisa Shepitko, ★★★★½ ," I mean...This movie, going against it's title portrays more of a descent as we watch the horrors of war unravel themselves on our two main characters journey. This conflict of trajectory is represented in our two leads personal journeys as well. Unfortunately in war a personal ascent is not to different from a descent.This film left me with a sense of loss in my gut, not only because of what I saw on screen but because of what films we might have had if Shepitko had not died so young. ***"
The Ascent,1977,Larisa Shepitko, ★★★★½ ," ""Don't crawl in shit. You'll never wash it off."" - Sotnikov, Gay?A brutal and beautiful film that is hard to look away from and hard to stop thinking about. The pacing is perfect, creating a slow building narrative that while being quite specific, generates so much to think about. The cinematography and direction is such that you could watch this without sound and still feel included and entertained. That said the sound is fantastic. Also... that ending!Way to go Russians! ***"
Lawrence of Arabia,1962,David Lean, ★★★★★ , (Saw in 70mm)When Lawrence blew out that match I gasped ***
Lawrence of Arabia,1962,David Lean, ★★★★½ , filmed entirely at the Indiana Dunes ***
Lawrence of Arabia,1962,David Lean, ★★★★½ ," how is a colonialist epic about a tormented sadist with a twinkle in his eyes so universally beloved?"" ... best not to answer that. what i find most amazing about Lean's masterpiece is that such a politically thorny, morally vague 228-minute film about a man's grand-scale psychic collapse has become such a celebrated movie, regarded as a treasure by EW and the the intelligentsia alike.i should probably say a little something about the 4K DCP presentation, but... i'm sleepy. maybe later. ***"
Lawrence of Arabia,1962,David Lean, ★★★½ , they played the extended cut which included all the gay sex scenes ***
Lawrence of Arabia,1962,David Lean, ★★★★½ ," I like sand. It's coarse, rough, and mesmerizing. And it gets everywhere. www.larsenonfilm.com/lawrence-of-arabia ***"
Lawrence of Arabia,1962,David Lean, ★★★★★ , alright maybe 4 hour movies DO have rights ***
Lawrence of Arabia,1962,David Lean, ★★★★★ ," Four glorious hours of camels walking in extreme long shot. Oh, and also a pretty devastating subversion of the white man's burden narrative, in which a man hates his own people and tries to go native, but is always reminded he cannot, no matter his accomplishments. Another epic on the subject would have ended in a blaze of glory. This one stops in a pool of self-contempt. Almost makes one look forward to the release of Lawrence's death seen in the film's opening. ***"
Lawrence of Arabia,1962,David Lean, None , EMBARGOED ***
Lawrence of Arabia,1962,David Lean, ★★★★★ , The classic tale of a weird but harmless gay man who gets famous and then becomes insufferable. ***
Lawrence of Arabia,1962,David Lean, ★★½ ," ""I had to execute someone, and there is something about it I didn't like."" -Lawrence, Four hours of colonialism, sand, brown face and boredom.. not my thing but the cinematography is outstanding. ***"
Lawrence of Arabia,1962,David Lean, ★★★★★ ," An egomaniac ventures abroad convinced that he can remake the world and that he wants to do so for noble reasons. He accomplishes nothing, gets scores of those who trusted him killed, commits some war crimes, and returns home consumed with self-loathing and the very same longing for purpose and meaning that pulled him away in the first place. Dated and irrelevant, obviously. ***"
Lawrence of Arabia,1962,David Lean, ★★★★★ ," Biblical literary epic for the screen. Vast when it needs to be, intimate when it should be. Saw it for the first time on the big screen. Which is probably the smallest screen you should see it on. ***"
Lawrence of Arabia,1962,David Lean, ★★ ," I ain't watching a 4-hour long movie about the desert, fuck off. ***"
Lawrence of Arabia,1962,David Lean, ★★★★½ ," Watched again for The Next Picture Show. The film is extremely front-loaded-- all the best and most memorable moments come pre-intermission, and it's more cleanly articulated as a piece of storytelling and a character study. Post-intermission gets messier, necessarily so to an extent, but one does slouch in one's chair ever-so-slightly. ***"
Lawrence of Arabia,1962,David Lean, ★★★½ ," why even try to write a proper review for this film when you can just cop out of it by saying that ""nothing is written"" instead ***"
Lawrence of Arabia,1962,David Lean, ★★★★★ , Absolutely stunning. One of those canon entries that perpetually exceeds the expectations set by the discussion around it.(Saw a brand-spankin'-new 70mm print at the MOMI and holy wow was it a tall drink of water.) ***

Lawrence of Arabia,1962,David Lean, ★★★★ ," **sand politics**I have a great appreciation for this film. Denis Villeneuve has gone on record to say this film has inspired some of his work. Although it is a long watch, Lawrence’s Character is extremely fascinating. I don’t recommend this for everyone. ***"
Lawrence of Arabia,1962,David Lean, ★★★★★ , There are scenes in this movie that are so stunning that after watching them I feel the need to take a moment to recover.Every time I see the scene where Lawrence blows out that match and it cuts to the sunrise it feels like I go to heaven for a split second. ***

Before Sunrise,1995,Richard Linklater, ★★★★★ ," If somebody had told 19 year-old me that one day I’d watch this intimate masterpiece with my 14 year-old daughter... after having a conversation with Ethan Hawke where, just like an Ethan Hawke character in a Richard Linklater movie, he oh-so-insightfully schooled me on the importance of giving said daughter permission to make mistakes, to break hearts and have her heart broken... well, I might’ve said that sounded like something from a Richard Linklater movie. There is some kind of magic in this world. ***"

It’s a sprawling 4 hour epic that also manages to feel very contained and personable.

Love Exposure,2008,Sion Sono, ★★★★★ ," Takes some basic plot mechanics and tropes from a boilerplate romcom, but stretches them to the length of Return of the (Pervert) King Extended (hehehehehe) Edition and peppers it with bad taste humor, graphic violence, and a big ol' reference to the Female Prisoner Scorpion movies. It's an absurd boner comedy epic that somehow winds up having an emotional impact. I feel like I just watched a magic trick.Best use of Bolero since 10. ***"
Love Exposure,2008,Sion Sono, ★★★★ ," A grand spectacle of 4 hours filled with crazy characters, an insane and drunken story, surprisingly fast pacing, mobile camera work, fairly fast editing, abundant music and a digital aesthetic that creates almost a nostalgic look. Humor, drama and action alternate flawlessly, there never seems to be a lack of a new idea, so it doesn't get boring for a second. Not that everything works equally well (especially in the second 2 hours), the humor is hit-or-miss, it mostly shouldn't spoil the fun. I don't see a real masterpiece in it, but the film offers so much viewing pleasure that it simply deserves its 4 stars. ***"

The Pianist,2002,Roman Polanski, ★★★★½ , Wladek Szpilman was not a hero.He's just a pianist. When the Germans invaded his country. He hid. He had to hide. He's just a pianist.They were trying to kill him. He did not understand why. He did nothing wrong.He's just a pianist.He watched as everyone around him got murdered. What could he do? He couldn't fight. He's just a pianist. Wladek knew he had to survive. He looked for food. He looked for shelter. He begged for help. He wept alone. Wladek Spzilman was not a hero.He's just a pianist. ***
The Pianist,2002,Roman Polanski, ★★★★ ," What do you call a Jew behind a piano?No?A pianist you racist bastard.Adrian Brody should have this on constant repeat to remind him how astonishing an actor he can be.

The Pianist,2002,Roman Polanski, ★★★★★ ," No doubt Adrien Brody and Roman Polanski won the Oscar for this.A Masterful film-making, superb writing, and a class acting... so brilliant. The supporting cast is also excellent.Emotional, sometimes depressing but a very realistic cinema. ***"
The Pianist,2002,Roman Polanski, ★★★★★ ," Polanski takes time out from bathing with pubescent girls to make another masterpiece of film. Aside from a dodgy performance from Emilia Fox - an actress who, tho very attractive, just cannot act - everything is perfect. Polanski is one of the great directors, there is no denying. Just be wary if he suggests he babysit while you're out at the movies. ***"

The Pianist,2002,Roman Polanski, ★★★★★ ," Adrien Brody is definitely my favorite Oscar win of all time, and no other comes even close. I get emotional everytime i re-watch his acting here or his speech during that night. So well deserved. 😭 And he was so real, he was so out of his body because of the excitement, that he pulled out that crazy ass move of kissing Halle Berry out of the blue, as if it was nothing LMFAO. God knows he would be cancelled to hell and back if that happened now days. Such an iconic moment!!! 😂 ***"
The Pianist,2002,Roman Polanski, ★★★★ , 20 of the 1001 movies before you die listThis film is a nice change for a war film. It was just set in the concentration camps or on the front lines. This film shows you a complete different part of the war. Adrien Brody was brilliant in this and the story was great while some of the shots were nice and the score was nice too.As well fuck Roman Polanski. ***

The Seventh Seal,1957,Ingmar Bergman, ★★★★★ , Max von Sydow was twenty-seven years old when he starred in one of the greatest films ever made. He died today. He was ninety. This is a movie about death. My wife found out the lump on her throat was benign today and then I watched this movie for the first time in probably twenty years while waiting for her to come home from work so I could give her a kiss. This is a movie about life.Death cheats at chess. Life cheats at death.The Max von Sydow project starts now. ***

The Seventh Seal,1957,Ingmar Bergman, ★★★★½ ," I don't feel worthy of analyzing this film.Bergman's two films of 1957 (this and Wild Strawberries) both approach the concepts of mortality and death from very different places. While our protagonist in Wild Strawberries fears death, Antonius does not fear death but does begin to appreciate the joy of living as he is confronted by death.The struggles with faith and death, the brutality of the world they live in, Seventh Seal is a beautiful and haunting film. ***"

The Seventh Seal,1957,Ingmar Bergman, ★★★★½ , The last 15 minutes are some of the finest and symbolic scenes I’ve ever seen. They accurately capture how much I don’t give a fuck about dying ***
The Seventh Seal,1957,Ingmar Bergman, ★★★★★ ," Max von Sydow has managed to escape death for so long, it just feels like a huge punch in the gut to think about the fact that we'd lost him.Down here, all I can really hope is that he's still playing chess with death now that they've joined forces.Rest in peace to a real legend. ***"
The Seventh Seal,1957,Ingmar Bergman, ★★★★★ , *someone mentions chess*OMG is this an ingmar bergman?? ***
The Seventh Seal,1957,Ingmar Bergman, ★★★ ," 2 years after the first viewing, Bergman's most well-known among his medieval scenarios still leaves me surprisingly cold. watched the german dubbed version (due to my parents displeasure of subtitles), the discrepancy between a serious desire and cross-humorous comedy numbers is even clearer. Even more visibly this time around a screenplay was developed directly from an original theater rehearsal for its actors - so fast, so little poignant that I stay amazed how this one got a lot of fame while his disregarded masterpiece Ansiktet seems to be a direct progression in the director's canon a year later. ***"
The Seventh Seal,1957,Ingmar Bergman, ★★★★ ," Super chill albino dude and pondering knight meet at the beach, hit it off and set out on a road trip to play retro board games while discussing the existence of God, the burden of faith and the inevitability of death. ***"
The Seventh Seal,1957,Ingmar Bergman, ★★ , I just wanted to watch a guy play death at a game of chess but instead had to sit through a bunch of weird and annoying scenes so as you can probably tell I was immensely disappointed. ***

Satantango,1994,Béla Tarr, ★★★★★ ," This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  A travelogue of purgatory at the end of history, with characters set adrift with only the manipulations of an eerily hypnotic cult-like figure to guide them. After seven arduous hours, the punchline hits: said absentee ruler is nothing but a rat for the cops, who no longer have a government to spy for but continue collecting and organizing dirt on otherwise completely abandoned citizens out of sheer mechanical memory. All that's left is the pain you can inflict on yourself and others to even feel alive.  ***"

Scenes from a Marriage,1974,Ingmar Bergman, ★★★★½ ," [theatrical version] Damn. Really wish I caught the 5 hour version first because I would have loved to sit and endure each and every detail of this relationship. Very rare for me to think something like that after spending nearly 3 hours with a movie that is entirely conversations, but Bergman's way of capturing the pain in these characters was too real to not feel completely immersed. Liv Ullmann has so much truth in her performance, specifically in the Paula chapter. Nothing captures the magic of the movies quite like divorce! ***"

After reading up on it, i decided to watch the episodic version versus the theatrical version because many people say the episodic was the way the creator wanted this to be viewed. Just got done with the first episode and I can tell I’m going to love this. I hope it stays that way. There is so much to unravel and I’m so eager to peel these characters apart.

Scenes from a Marriage,1974,Ingmar Bergman, ★★ ," #77 on the all-time list and i'm even one big Bergman apologist in general... but no. completely dominated by dialogue, fatigue-inducingly exhausting and oddly naive. Bergman also outlining his shady character en passant. this should age badly. one of his most excruciating films. ***"
Scenes from a Marriage,1974,Ingmar Bergman, ★★★★ ," “Forgive me. Forgive us.”I would never treat Liv Ullmann like this.Again Bergman does so much with such a simple premise letting the writing and performances steer the story forward. Amazing execution, incredible performances from the leads and surprisingly good pacing. Bergman’s direction and the themes are excellent. Still I prefer his shorter films but Liv Ullmann makes any film 10x better. Overall,Incredible acting, incredible dialogue and one heartfelt and crushing experience. Highly recommend! ***"
Scenes from a Marriage,1974,Ingmar Bergman, ★★★★½ , watched the 5 hour miniseries. kinda speechless. Johan is the worst person in film. and Marianne's journey is so incredibly heartbreaking she was so close to breaking free. Liv Ullmann the greatest actor ever I think. ***

Scenes from a Marriage is a beautiful, but sad, story about the dissolution of a marriage and the isolation that it brings.

Haven't seen a bunch of Kieślowski to decide whether it's his magnum opus, but out of the Three Colours trilogy, Red is the one that shines the brightest.Such a great character drama. With impeccable, thoughtful dialogue, fleshed-out characters, and just really perfect scenarios surrounding them, I could never look away from the screen. Irène Jacob is a delight to the eyes. Would recommend it to anyone who enjoys great dramas or great films in general. You can't go wrong with a Kieślowski. ***"

The Maestro takes the grand themes of religion, poverty, and love, and makes them supporting players in the operatic journey of a vivacious prostitute. “Nights of Cabiria” shows the best of Fellini’s deep humanistic understanding of finding beauty in the silly, and profundity in the absurd. All the gold in the Catholic Church somehow cannot equal the enchantment of a smile paired with single tear in the corner of Giulietta Masina’s eye. ***"

Nights of Cabiria,1957,Federico Fellini, ★★★★ ," As La Strada have shown, Massina can sell longing like few. Fellini's most romantic film part because his masochism has never been shouldered under such likable figure, part because those images of Cabiria moving through a series of Italian self-mythologies is as touching on its way as the misses of Visconti White Nights. All 50s Fellini movies are fables of reconstruction, and this push the idea towards the limit before 60s decadentism can kick in. ***"

Nights of Cabiria,1957,Federico Fellini, ★★★★★ ," El corazón se me hace pedazos al ver esta película.

Nights of Cabiria,1957,Federico Fellini, ★★★★★ , Giulietta Masina. ***
Nights of Cabiria,1957,Federico Fellini, ★★★★½ ," After several failed attempts to find happiness that have left her humiliated, broke, and alone, Cabiria finds herself in almost exactly the same position she was in at the start of the movie. Encounters with celebrity, the church (with its gaudy pageantry), and even hypnotism all fail her along the way. Yet in the end, this amazingly resilient, proud woman is able to look us in the eye and smile. Beautiful. ***"
Nights of Cabiria,1957,Federico Fellini, None ," If you think that a happy and optimistic ending will distract me from how lonely I feel after this then you are WRONG, if you need me I'll be blaring snow patrol in my room until someone comes to love me. ***"
Nights of Cabiria,1957,Federico Fellini, ★★★★ ," All men are pigs.Fellini’s iconic aimless narrative is often charming and crucial to understanding the concepts at play in his films, and while that’s certainly true in Nights of Cabiria, there were times where it felt more distracting than necessary. However the sometimes meandering first half is overshadowed by an amazing performance from Giulietta Masina and a masterfully devastating final 10 minutes.8.5 / 10 ***"

Nights of Cabiria,1957,Federico Fellini, ★★★★½ ," Discussed on the third anniversary of The Cinephiliacs with Two Lovers and The Immigrant writer/director James Gray. Had not seen a Fellini since my first year of college, and this made me want to give him another spin—clearly an adroit classicist at heart as much as Antonioni was, but with a bouncy surface that indulges in order to reveal hidden layers of depth within the emotions. There's a clarity to the filmmaking that instead of simplifying moments gives them enormous depth and breathe. Perhaps the greatest film performance of all time. ***"
Nights of Cabiria,1957,Federico Fellini, ★★★★½ ," Giullietta Masina is magical as Cabiria. She's a woman whom after years of sex work and abuse from men- that extends to attempted murder and robbery- she never loses her faith in humanity. She has a strength in that humanity that is rarely explored through film, as film oftentimes shows battered people succumbing to battering back in a cathartic form of revenge but with a half-baked message of revenge's damage underneath it (that's a little unfair- there's some movies that do this fantastically).But Nights of Cabiria is about the strength of the unbreakable human spirit, all the way to the amazing final shot ***"
Nights of Cabiria,1957,Federico Fellini, ★★★★★ ," Giulietta Masina is outstanding as Cabiria. She made me laugh, she intimidated me, and she broke my heart all at the same time. Probably one of my favorite movie characters ever.also, that ending scene was soooooooo perfect. It was tragic but i couldn’t help myself from smiling with Cabiria ;-; ***"

M,1931,Fritz Lang, ★★★★★ ," The early 1930’s was an awkward transition for filmmaking. Most filmmakers at the time struggled to use sound effectively in their movies, but not Fritz Lang. The sound incorporation in his first talkie is innovative and well ahead of its time. The camerawork is smooth, unique, and gripping to its social commentary. In short, M is a masterpiece like no other. ***"
M,1931,Fritz Lang, ★★★★★ , I’m glad no one ever told Fritz Lang that an entire society couldn’t be the protagonist. (...and antagonist.) ***

M,1931,Fritz Lang, ★★★½ ," Hi guys, today is my birthday so what better to upload than this masterpiece of cinema (I watched it yesterday, 30th of June).Here we are with this German thriller movie released in 1931.It’s based on real events and it’s one of the first pieces to use sound!It’s about the manhunt of a killer of children, everything takes places in Düsseldorf.This movie depicts a big confrontation between legal laws and natural ways of acting towards this kind of situations.Full review in my blog.My blog entries list 🍿🍿 ***"
M,1931,Fritz Lang, ★★★★★ , Peter Lorre's monologue at the end of this film is the reason movies are made. ***
M,1931,Fritz Lang, ★★★½ ," Ah, yes. Finally a movie about one of my favorite letters from the alphabet.7/10 ***"
M,1931,Fritz Lang, ★★★★½ , Why do bash “Kindermörder” killers for slaughtering little kids but we never question if the child has bad vibes? Or if they’re just unpleasant to be around? ***
M,1931,Fritz Lang, ★★★★½ ," After seeing this 89 year old classic, its obvious just how influential M has been. It really is an early blueprint of how to do psychological thrillers. It expertly blurs the line between what is deemed right and wrong making your own moral compass feel foggy. Lang really captured this city's collective anger and thirst to catch the killer, in turn making all the citizens a single character trying to take down one man who walks among them. The final twenty minutes are breathtaking as we see everything converge to explore justice and morality within society.Fantastic film that was ahead of its time. ***"
M,1931,Fritz Lang, ★★★★½ ," This first police procedural and serial killer drama is an intricate,socio-political and paradigm-altering portrait of pre-Nazi Germany. Being called a blueprint for today's films of this kind, I wasn't expecting anything fresh but surprisingly, it still stands tall after 90 years and gained immortality.Lang not only invented a sub-genre but also perfected it in the first place.Peter Lorre as Hans Beckert deserves all applause for that crescendo of a performance. ***"
M,1931,Fritz Lang, ★★★★ , Omg so this was NOT a prequel to Easy A??? I am so confused ***
M,1931,Fritz Lang, ★★★★½ ," M. is known for being the first disturbing serial killer film of the sound era. Peter Lorre is the child murderer who can’t help his compulsive thrill for overpowering his young prey. The Berlin townspeople form a vigilante party to hunt him down, proving more staunch than police. The film has a notable showdown in a basement where the suspect is trapped and gazed at by vengeful, dark faces. Directed by Fritz Lang (“Metropolis”); his use of silhouettes and low contrast lighting, from front to back, is peak expressionism. ***"
M,1931,Fritz Lang, ★★★★½ ," This shit is so ahead of it's time, it's insane... ***"
M,1931,Fritz Lang, ★★★★ , it's definitely not bad for a film that's only one year younger than Clint Eastwood ***

Which brings me sadness as I hear the news of Jonathan Demme's passing. Jonathan Demme brought suspense, thrills, fun, and intrigue which makes for one of the most interesting filmographies out there. R.I.P. Jonathan Demme ***"

A Man Escaped,1956,Robert Bresson, ★★★★★ ," A formally stripped-down, detailed process of human resilience in the face of historical deprivation and isolation. ***"
A Man Escaped,1956,Robert Bresson, ★★★★ ," 75/100Process, process, process. Robert Bresson's A Man Escaped focuses more on the different valleys and peaks of reaching an end goal rather than the consequences of such tribulations. It's a film comprised of footsteps, whispers, minor errors, minor victories, and the celebratory rush of triumph over hardship. While most films ""fade to black"" to signify an end or a particular moment of importance, the key to A Man Escaped is its usage of the fade as an assured step into danger and the reluctant quest for hope. For Bresson, every movement and action is just the beginning. ***"

A Man Escaped,1956,Robert Bresson, ★★★★★ ," As a realistic, breathtaking, influential and heart-pounding recount of a true POW story, it is a shining triumph. Bresson's style of constantly moving from one relevant event to another and letting images speak while assigning a great importance to silences and facial expressions confirms the truth hidden in the phrase ""in simplicity lies complexity"". Your complaint is that the title sells away the ending, right? Bresson has never cared about the outcomes; instead, his humanity testaments focus on the struggle of life itself given a set of circumstances. That's why he's misunderstood: not all people have fought for their lives even once.97/100 ***"

A Man Escaped,1956,Robert Bresson, ★★★★★ ," A Man Escaped is captivating, spiritual, and feels like a triumph in every regard. Bresson does so much with so little, placing the viewers in prison as well, feeling every small achievement Fontaine does. The finding of a spoon feels grandiose in the span of this runtime, and each mini triumph gives us that much more hope. The sound design is also very incredible, footsteps and keys running along stairs are established early on to keep viewers listening, making sure Fontaine isn't ever in danger. If there was a film that best captures the essence of human spirit, this would be the one. Fantastic. ***"
A Man Escaped,1956,Robert Bresson, ★★★★½ ," Scavenger Hunt #52A Man Escaped is one of the most tensest films I’ve seen even though the title tells you what happens. This is mainly down to the phenomenal lead performance that gets you behind the character from the start. The slow pace also builds up the tension perfectly until the edge of the seat climax.I wasn’t sure what to expect from this film but now I can’t wait to see more from Robert Bresson. I highly recommend this film to anyone who hasn’t seen it, I can’t imagine anyone not liking it. ***"
A Man Escaped,1956,Robert Bresson, ★★★★ , More than one person escaped! so there for the title lied. ***
A Man Escaped,1956,Robert Bresson, ★★★★ ," A Man Escaped is a minimalistic look at the harsh nature of imprisonment. It’s a meticulously crafted film that ensures each and every action carried out by the protagonist fully immerses us in his monotonous daily routine. Because of that, there are moments that require immense patience from the viewer, but the many carefully calculated moments of suspense (specifically those in the third act) make the whole journey worth it. Bresson is a master! ***"
A Man Escaped,1956,Robert Bresson, ★★★★ ," Another win for Bresson. Only his craft can have this minimalist prison break drama result into a captivating triumph. Always attentive to the protagonist and his process of breaking out, with the film’s camera work and editing generating the right amount of unpredictability and suspense. A Man Escaped is prodigious with its techniques and directing, Robert Bresson is a true master. ***"
A Man Escaped,1956,Robert Bresson, ★★★★★ ," Para escapar da prisão da vida é preciso escapar da prisão dos sentidos, que os olhos pegam-nos partidas. Reduzir tudo ao denominador comum.

I Am Cuba,1964,Mikhail Kalatozov, ★★½ , Yiff in hell Fidel ***
I Am Cuba,1964,Mikhail Kalatozov, ★★★½ ," What's interesting about this film is that it is a piece of pro-Castro propaganda, but at the same time the vignettes meant to illustrate the injustice of the Batista years are genuinely emotionally involving. Even though Kalatozov's vision is political, he focuses intently on his human subjects. I'm amazed that a movie made by the bloody Soviet Union ten years after the death of Stalin can grasp of how to make a film with a political agenda while still creating moments between people that feel genuine. Yet, every chuckleheaded Hollywood knob who has tackled the Iraq war has ended up creating a bloodless, didactic mess ***"
I Am Cuba,1964,Mikhail Kalatozov, ★★★★★ ," ***One of the best 150 films I have ever seen.***Kalatozov constructs an opera of striking visuals, cinematic wonders and groundbreaking technical qualities, featuring the most magnificent camera work on celluloid. The spirit of revolution and rebellion is vivid and alive throughout, but the superb poetry displayed in every frame accentuates more the meaning of true cinema construction rather than the intoxicating Communist propaganda that the Soviet Union wanted to spread in the 60s through the Cuban ideals and their great strength of will to die for an ideal (which, in my honest opinion, was bigger than themselves).100/100 ***"

The freedom of the camera is the freedom that communism is. We see the Cuban people struggle but we also see them rise to the occasion. Essential. ***
I Am Cuba,1964,Mikhail Kalatozov, ★★★★½ ," Before you even take into account how effective this is as a propaganda film (the enemy is not a caricature of the ""other"", it is the conditions of poverty and exploitation), the most obvious thing to note his how technically masterful this is. The framing, lighting, shot composition and editing are all fantastic, not to mention the virtuosic camera work, boasting some of the best long takes of all time. ***"
I Am Cuba,1964,Mikhail Kalatozov, ★★★½ ," Some of the most incredible camera work I've ever seen.I mean, how are some of these shots even physically possible? Those oppening scenes? That funeral scene? Truly mindblowing.It can drag at times and I think it should have ended right after the famous funeral scene (not that what came after it was bad or anything, it just really seemed like the perfect place for it to end since this movie is pretty long), but this is a must-watch, especially if you're a fan of excellent camera work. It's seriously impressive. ***"

Wild Strawberries,1957,Ingmar Bergman, ★★★★★ ," 98I have finally found it. The film I cannot review. Any type of cohesive thought soon reduces me into a blubbering mess. All I feel is pure melancholy, and it reaches into the deepest depths of my soul while simultaneously enlightening my current self. This is a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful film, and that's all I have. ***"
Wild Strawberries,1957,Ingmar Bergman, ★★★★ ," This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  This is good because it's like A Christmas Carol if the ghosts of your past were crippling loneliness, and how you never got to marry your cousin.  ***"
Wild Strawberries,1957,Ingmar Bergman, ★★★★½ ," so many themes packed into just 91 minutes: aging, guilt, regret, death, dreams, subconsciousness, memories, marriage, love, fear ... all standard for bergman’s oeuvre but especially realized here. amazing how he crafted such a tender, credible portrait of an elderly man when he himself was just under 40. Wild Strawberries feels like a swan song, somehow sung 60 years before his death. happy birthday, ingmar 💙 ***"

Wild Strawberries,1957,Ingmar Bergman, ★★★★½ ," “If I have been feeling worried or sad during the day, I have a habit of recalling scenes from childhood to calm me. So it was this evening.” ***"
Wild Strawberries,1957,Ingmar Bergman, ★★★★ ," One thing I’m noticing throughout my Bergman watch through is how every single shot has a purpose. No frame is wasted. Every shot manages to elicit the themes when dark, powerful and sorrowful. The close up shots with the long monologues are just a delight to see, and you can really see the influence that Bergman has had on cinema. This style is definitely not for everyone, but there is just so much to appreciate. ***"
Wild Strawberries,1957,Ingmar Bergman, ★★★★½ , A poignant film that explores the themes of aging and regret. It's a reminder to make the most of every moment - and to never let your cousin marry anyone else but you. ***
Wild Strawberries,1957,Ingmar Bergman, ★★★★★ , let’s all try to do a little better than our fathers and hope our sons do a little better than us ***
Wild Strawberries,1957,Ingmar Bergman, ★★★★★ ," A movie full of contrasts: old age against youth, past against present, life against death, science against religion, and our protagonist, the man who embraces all contradictions: a dead alive, who longs for death while holding onto life with all of his strength. ***"
Wild Strawberries,1957,Ingmar Bergman, ★★★★★ ," Victor’s first dream is one of the classic sequences of mid-century world cinema: wandering down empty streets, he observes a clock with no hands, a man with a horribly squinched face and then a horse-drawn carriage with a hearse. One guess as to whose body lies inside. Edited according to the illogical rhythm of dreams – and a nice nod to Sjostrom’s own directorial masterwork, the 1921 silent film The Phantom Carriage – it’s the ultimate mortality nightmare.A bit more here. ***"

Wild Strawberries,1957,Ingmar Bergman, ★★★★★ ," To me, the most complete and compelling Bergman film I’ve seen. At times it’s hypnotizing, melodic, feels like an existential lullaby. And I’m all for it. ***"
Wild Strawberries,1957,Ingmar Bergman, ★★★★★ ," ""I am very glad you came, and I hope to see you again. "" -Mrs. Borg, - Bergman Ranked: boxd.it/dYNt0- Secret Cinema: boxd.it/auRvsPain. I think I finally figured out this Bergman fellow.... and I like him! This film ripped my heart out and ate it whole. As an aging professor with decades of regret behind him already I think it's possible I'll think about this film at least once a week, if not more, for the rest of my life. Yes. ***"
Wild Strawberries,1957,Ingmar Bergman, ★★★½ ," neat, splendid and swell but fragmentary, episodic and of a magnified technocratic pragmatism concerning all characters involved except the protagonist. too much story-driven instead of enhancing the classic-bergmanesque reflexivity. also, too bright for a film about age, nostalgia and the impending death. much aligned with his other considered masterpiece of that era, The Seventh Seal. ***"
Wild Strawberries,1957,Ingmar Bergman, ★★★★★ , Oh Fuucckk ***
Wild Strawberries,1957,Ingmar Bergman, ★★★★★ , I LOVE THIS FILM!WATCH IT!I worked in the film section of a library & the foreign films were novel to me & blew my mind.

The 400 Blows,1959,François Truffaut, ★★★★★ ," The cinematic equivalent of comfort food.This is now a favorite. Every shot of this film is a gorgeous gift, packed with warm, quiet wonder. The sparse musical theme is an utter delight.I love the ending more and more each time I watch it. After being trapped in the endless urban cycle of mischief, rules, and misunderstanding, it's unbelievably cathartic to watch Antoine just run away from it all. Run, without any of the loud, confusing distractions of the city, just the soft sounds of birds chirping and the ocean breeze. ***"

The 400 Blows,1959,François Truffaut, ★★★★½ ," Hell is adolescence. Fierce, uncompromising filmmaking. Few films I've seen set the stage, setting, atmosphere and character as masterful as The 400 Blows. And holy shit, it's a debut! This is my first François Truffaut, and my next step into french new wave (like, my second ever FNW film next to Umbrellas by Jacques Demy). I've heard countless times how the ending is so good and.... yeah, it's pretty fucking great. Loneliness, heartache, yet freedom. ***"

The 400 Blows,1959,François Truffaut, ★★★★ ," I've said it once and I'll say it again... there is so much beauty in simplicity. The 400 Blows is a really tender, yet oddly haunting, coming of age story about a child who knows no path, no guidance, and is struggling with adolescence. ***"
All About Eve,1950,Joseph L. Mankiewicz, ★★★★★ ," i was the only one in the theater for this, which is a shame.actually, before the film started, there was a couple a few rows back, but when the black and white fox logo appeared, one of them said ""this isn't La La Land,"" and then they walked out.damn straight this ain't La La Land, it actually won best picture. ***"

All About Eve,1950,Joseph L. Mankiewicz, ★★★★★ ," Maybe the greatest film ever made about performance. Not only is it as brilliant a look into the machinations of (surrogate) Hollywood as something like Sunset Boulevard, it also examines the nature of performance and its (deleterious) effect on identity and personal agency and the perception of those around you. One need not be a great person to be a great personality; in fact, the more the personality, the less the person.Or maybe I just like movies about female sociopaths. ***"

All About Eve,1950,Joseph L. Mankiewicz, ★★★★½ , Theater people amirite ***
All About Eve,1950,Joseph L. Mankiewicz, ★★★★★ ," I always knew I would eat this up, it was just a matter of when. A high art Hollywood film that calls movies low art. Is this an act of comedic reverence to the theatre world it’s presenting, or an overt vehicle for self-insistence? This and Birdman both disparage Hollywood slop and both won the most esteemed award in Hollywood, but what good is the highest praise in a bottom-feeding competition inherently tied to such cultural poison? Maybe the problem isn’t so much the contents of the work but the identity crises that subsume the performers, in which case the theatre clearly isn’t any better off. ***"

Bicycle Thieves,1948,Vittorio De Sica, ★★★★★ ," This is the first neorealistic Italian film I've watched. The unfair humiliation of a man, a father who does everything to provide for his family until his bike, his only means of work, is stolen. The soundtrack will haunt me for a very long time, this social drama has a realism that broke my heart, all under the eyes of his kid. A powerful lesson on life and humilityThe final sequence is masterful .... My best movies of all time  ***"

Late Spring,1949,Yasujirō Ozu, ★★★★ ," There is a seemingly minor shot in Late Spring—a masterful, mid-career domestic drama from Yasujiro Ozu—in which a pile of magazines slides off a chair and falls to the floor. It occurs after one of the film’s many intensely quiet conversations among characters, thereby functioning as a visual exclamation point. Notice, though, how many times after this shot we see a character pick something up and set it on a chair or a table: a cloth, a piece of paper, in one case a dropped coin purse. Above all else, Late Spring is about putting things in their proper place.www.larsenonfilm.com/late-spring ***"

Late Spring,1949,Yasujirō Ozu, ★★★★½ ," one of the most profoundly human films i've ever seen. ozu is able to capture emotions and relationships so perfectly, from their sweetest moments to their most heartbreaking. this film portrays the relationship between a father and a daughter, and the feeling of not wanting to leave your past behind, in such a simple but beautiful way. ozu's films fill me with such a passion and love for cinema that i haven't felt in a long time, and this is my favorite of his so far 💓 ***"
Late Spring,1949,Yasujirō Ozu, ★★★★★ , Setsuko's graceful screen presence will forever be unmatched. Such simple elegance and such subtle emotion. Some of my absolute favourite pillow shots from Ozu and definitely the most poignant film of his from all that I've seen.Tokyo Story is undeniably his opus but I think I'll always have a fraction more affinity for this film.The finale tugs at my heart like nothing else.18x4 Directors Challenge | 🇯🇵 | Ozu (2/4) ***
Late Spring,1949,Yasujirō Ozu, ★★★★ ," My first Ozu and it was superb. And here's the funny thing: it frequently set off my ASMR, which for me is usually a response to a sense of stillness and peace, in which people are quietly focused on carrying out a simple task. And here, conversations bloom and meanings unfold out of simple activities: writing, eating, changing clothes, peeling an apple. Shots are low and static and exquisitely composed, with characters walking in and out of shot; intimate and poignant. A beautiful, tender film. ***"

When he filmed Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, he used a handheld camera as ""shakycam"" to represent the two losing control of the situation.

Singin' in the Rain,1952,Stanley Donen, ★★★★★ ," Obviously a clockwork piece of synchronized color, choreography, and music but also just an incredibly sharp and funny industry satire that pokes fun at itself while simultaneously buying into every ludicrously romantic, fantastic image it can come up with an excuse to conjure in 100 minutes. Beautiful compositions and athletic movement made to appear as effortless and joyous as possible. A perfect movie. Was a dream to see this in a theater.[35mm] ***"

Where Is the Friend's House?,1987,Abbas Kiarostami, ★★★★½ ," Adults talk too much but they never listen.Abbas Kiarostami's pure, wide-eyed observation of the extraordinary mundanity pared down to quintessential filmic elements with a story that could be summed up in two sentences, spanning a mere 24 hours of action operating within the confines of two dilapidated small towns of Koker and Pohsteh. Also, it's a generous little film that felt like a warm, cordial hug and yet at the same time, it was the most anxiety-filled 83 minutes of my life. Magical stuff - The flower in the book is a testament to that. ***"
Where Is the Friend's House?,1987,Abbas Kiarostami, ★★★★ ," Simple, beautiful, and captivating.Ahmed has my heart. I am a sucker for childhood-centric films and this was able to capture the charm that only a few can manage. Kiarostami gives us human kindness, friendship, and magic through our lead, Ahmed. I am reminded of how everyday heroics, no matter how seemingly small, will always stand out in this world of chaos. The 83 minutes fly by beautifully.My first Kiarostami film, recommended by Denise!! 💛Sinegang weekly pick #10Check out our Letterboxd profile here. ***"

Where Is the Friend's House?,1987,Abbas Kiarostami, ★★★★★ ," i don’t know what to say!!! being able to witness this level of compassion really took me aback.. it’s a story about the inherent kindness instilled in children, and the tragedy of trying to navigate those instincts while the adults around either ignore you, or lead you astray. because too often, tenderness is met with difficulty & doubt. kiarostami is the greatest and his work leaves me feeling so seen, and so full of love for both people & just the act of having the courage to tell stories. ***"
Where Is the Friend's House?,1987,Abbas Kiarostami, ★★★★ ," Cinematic stories about children will always deeply affect me, especially when the filmmaking is not intrusive or manipulative. That’s why I’m forever grateful for Abbas Kiarostami’s films; they reveal broad themes through such simple narratives, without ever teetering on the edge of unnecessary melodrama. Where Is My Friend’s House? is a sweet film, and the most fitting for World Kindness Day (something I didn’t even know existed until I checked the twitter trending topics 5 minutes ago). ***"
Where Is the Friend's House?,1987,Abbas Kiarostami, ★★★★ ," It's a poetic social commentary film that tells the story of Ahmed, a boy who after realized that he accidentally got his friend's notebook and headed from Koker to Poshteh to return his friend's notebook. Throughout the movie we can see conservative thoughts from adults in movies which are selfish and despotic. The story is very simple but presented in such a poetic and beautiful way. By showing the flaws in Iranian society, adults dominate the new generation with conservatism and traditionalism. By far, I'm so excited to go through the rest of the trilogy. ***"
Where Is the Friend's House?,1987,Abbas Kiarostami, ★★★★½ ," A heartfelt portrayal of the Sisyphean urge to do the right thing, even when it seems impossible. A case for making empathy great again. ***"
Where Is the Friend's House?,1987,Abbas Kiarostami, ★★★★½ ," The ending is a pure mic drop moment. The compassion of a children trumps all.

I think this is my favorite of the three but I can't quite put my finger on why that is... perhaps because I am so settled into the world at this point that I really enjoy seeing the conclusion. Everyone should see this trilogy. ***"
Apur Sansar,1959,Satyajit Ray, ★★★★½ ," One of the things I like the most about this trilogy is how natural, yet heatrbreaking it feels. It deals with emotional moments that I recognize. Family, love interests, career path, all of these three elements are present in a way that I understand and could look at as being my own. ""Apur Sansar"" has Apu now dealing with adulthood and failure. And there aren't many adults who can't associate themselves with those two terms, as for it is in adult age that all the fantasies of childhood break into pieces and reality kicks in. ***"
Apur Sansar,1959,Satyajit Ray, ★★★½ , i love Apu’s character so much. what a great end to the trilogy ***
Apur Sansar,1959,Satyajit Ray, ★★★★★ ," Without a doubt the strongest of the trilogy. I love this one the most but in order to fully appreciate this you obviously, need to of seen the other two in order for the journey to be fully realised. And fully realised it is with this, The World of Apu.Whilst I didn't find the other two as powerful as this, as a whole the trilogy is pretty much perfect and the rating displayed here can pretty much be applied to the trilogy as a whole. Humane cinema at it's finest. ***"
Apur Sansar,1959,Satyajit Ray, ★★★★★ ," The best trilogy in existence. Sorry, Toy Story. ***"
Apur Sansar,1959,Satyajit Ray, ★★★★★ ," There is a scene in the early stages of this film in which a bunch of children are playing and Apu looks at them smiles and continues about his business, this scene always makes me a little sad because all of what Apu has been through from that age and he's lost his childlike wonder. ***"

Apur Sansar,1959,Satyajit Ray, ★★★★ ," Saw a version of this without subtitles, and I still understood what was happening on screen. That's the power of visual storytelling in cinema, specifically Ray's cinema. So powerful and again, *human*. Filled with the trials and tribulations of life and yet still persistent on finding the real beauty in it. Everything comes full circle here from where it began in Pather Panchali. I really liked it a lot. ***"
Apur Sansar,1959,Satyajit Ray, ★★★★½ ," Terrific feat of storytelling, and one of the most beautiful and impressive endings to a trilogy/long form story. Loved it and thered a lot more to say, but yeah it's really beautiful, best of the trilogy. ***"
Apur Sansar,1959,Satyajit Ray, ★★★★★ ," I watched the first installment of this trilogy, Pather Panchali, back in 2014 just as I was getting into film. After two years, in 2016, Aparajito was one of the first movies I watched after starting a Letterboxd account. Now, in 2021 and in a style very much characteristic of myself, I’ve finally completed the trilogy. It feels as if I’ve grown up with Apu. ***"
Apur Sansar,1959,Satyajit Ray, ★★★★★ , This film is next to a masterpiece. It is a pure cinematic experience. So eye soothing. Apur Sansar will be on my top favorite movie list. An artistic masterpiece with deep narratives from Sir. Satyajit Ray. It's a true gem. ***
Ordet,1955,Carl Theodor Dreyer, ★★★★★ ," I’ve long believed that the two summits of mise en scène in the history of cinema are Carl Dreyer’s Ordet and Jacques Tati’s Playtime...""Because Jonathan Rosenbaum isn't wrong.Because this shot.Because the ending is perhaps the most simple, confounding, shocking, inevitable, breathtaking, breath-giving(?)... in all of cinema. ***"

Ordet,1955,Carl Theodor Dreyer, ★★★★★ ," Dos únicos filmes deste mundo que consegue efetivamente intuir a natureza sobrenatural da fé, que consegue encená-la e fazer disso um mote universal e um drama psicológico dos mais destruidores. Incrível como mesmo dentro de um espaço físico bastante limitado existe um senso de dinâmica cênica cinematográfica sem igual. Dreyer pode até partir de uma lógica visivelmente teatral em toda a marcação e a articulação dramática das cenas em longas sequências, possivelmente uma adaptação mais do que fiel a peça original, mas no final das contas fica sempre muito claro que ele abraça mesmo uma essência espacial absolutamente cinematográfica. ***"
Ordet,1955,Carl Theodor Dreyer, ★★★★★ ," Faith as an idea and how cinema is an art ideally positioned to move into the realm of the concrete. There's no stop talk about the subject and its many complications, but what matters is how Dreyer images suggest presence. Call it God or the auteur hand, neither benign or punish, but an organizing principle that remains through the images. The famous resurrection remains a triumph of believe and of the body. ***"
Ordet,1955,Carl Theodor Dreyer, ★★★★★ ," Ordet, based on a 1932 play by Danish playwright and Lutheran country priest Kaj Munk, manages to unusually feel both excessively theatrical and incredibly cinematic at the same time. Directed by Carl Theodor Dreyer, and the sole movie in his filmography to be both a critical and financial success, and deservedly winning the Golden Lion at the Venice International Film Festival. It's a tremendous narrative which takes place in a small scale locality without feeling enclosed or restricted in the sturdy and substantial treatment of its themes of religious intolerance. ***"

Dreyer's films always mix conflicting moods, and the simultaneous critique and upholding of faith here is handled with mise-en-scene practically unrivaled in cinema. ***"
Ordet,1955,Carl Theodor Dreyer, ★★★★★ ," Só mesmo o Dreyer pra fazer um ateu cair de joelhos perante um filme desses. Com extrema economia dos elementos da mise-en-scène e na edição, mas com planos de deixar qualquer um boquiaberto, me vi realocar meu usual deboche quanto à fé e me entregar à essa maravilhosidade do cinema, coisa que nem Bresson conseguira antes.Box Versátil A Arte de Carl Theodor Dreyer. ***"

I have little interest in religion in general and films that heavily touch on those themes rarely resonate with me, so it's not hugely surprising my enjoyment was low, but I still hoped for more. For all its grand dialogue and monologues, Ordet feels so empty and devoid of any connection for me, spiritual or otherwise. ***"

Army of Shadows,1969,Jean-Pierre Melville, ★★★★★ ," survival itself as a luxury, earned by the pain of having to kill your own humanity so that it cannot be stolen from you by the oppressor; you will suffer, you will perish, you will be forgotten, but you must resist, you will exist. if we're all destined for the grave, you meet death on your own terms, not at the whims of a fascist. that is the melville ethos. ***"
Army of Shadows,1969,Jean-Pierre Melville, ★★★★½ ," Top-notch filmmaking from start to end. The narrative, acting, tone, colors, themes, editing, score, its all so precise and impeccable - everything goes well hand in hand as it depicts the French resistance fight during WWII and their internal problems, the impact of war on ordinary people and the difficult moral decisions they are forced to make. Its quiet, slow, methodical, bleak and without a lot of explosions and violence, but instead a lot of tension, paranoia and dread. Arguably Melville's ""best"" film, though it didn't do a lot for me emotionally. I was lucky to catch it in a theatre as well! ***"
Army of Shadows,1969,Jean-Pierre Melville, ★★★★★ ," Thinking of Heat, and how shadows provide requisite cover until they don’t, not by failure to predict their behavior—it’s physics, light and dark—but failure to predict our own, and our comrades’. ***"

Army of Shadows,1969,Jean-Pierre Melville, ★★★★★ ," Melville's challenge even to himself and his abilities scratches cinematic perfection, whose remnants would be seen plaguing the 70s including the atmospheric mood and the flawless cinematography present throughout Le Cercle Rouge (1970). Excellent performances by notorious actors including Simone Signoret provide a memorable ensemble personality of revolutionary proportions. Extraordinaire!99/100 ***"
Army of Shadows,1969,Jean-Pierre Melville, ★★★ ," A little dissapointing since this should work for me on paper. The cinematography is great (beautiful cold color palette), the performances are powerful, there are handful of thrilling scenes, but it felt like it lacked some substance, especially considering its runtime it felt pretty stretched. A few scenes were also weird for me like the escape and its cheesy ending (yes, cheesy). Although I love the type of approach I think it easily could’ve been better, especially the second act. ***"

Army of Shadows,1969,Jean-Pierre Melville, ★★★★★ ," Jean-Pierre Melville's masterpiece Army of Shadows is a stunningly bleak, provocative and a powerful film about the French Resistance during WWII.

Army of Shadows,1969,Jean-Pierre Melville, ★★ ," NO ADMITTANCE M3GAN, play ""French Resistance ASMR"" until I fall asleep peacefully or die, whichever happens first. If you like the quiet droll of a motor humming, of a plane flying, of a French dude talking, then step right up because this is gonna be your friggin Citizen Kane.

Army of Shadows,1969,Jean-Pierre Melville, ★★★★★ ," Watched with @cinema.madeArmy of Shadows is truly one of the best anti-war movies I've seen. It's very slow burn but didn't feel slow enough to me. Obviously, I love the slow build up to set the tone and tension. Giving the director Jean Pierre-Melville who I absolutely admired his craft to this film. This movie without a doubt is a classic and will never forget what I just experienced. Thanks @cinema.made for recommending this gem! ***"

Army of Shadows,1969,Jean-Pierre Melville, ★★★★½ , this is a lot to take in. army of shadows is not your average war film. it's more like a spy thriller. but it's bleak. it's so bleak. this is the first film i've watched in a long time that managed to send genuine chills down my spine. there's images that will stay with me for a long time. it's a never ending cycle of resistance being squashed by oppressors to the point where it feels hopeless. soul crushing. ***

I see the scene where Salieri and Mozart are composing the funeral march sort of the same as Pacino and De Niro’s first meeting in Heat. They’d obviously interacted dozens of times before, but never so intimately or with such truth, like they were actually meeting for the first time. In another life they might’ve been friends.

A slowly paced and loving reflection on mortality and what it means to live a fulfilled life. Eternity and a Day is a really pretty film with a serene vibe that gives you time to take in everything and really think about it. I'm not sure how this would play to a younger crowd, not constantly engaged in thinking about their demise, but I think the messages are conveyed powerfully enough that most people should like this. Bruno Ganz is fantastic and I love the ending. Yes. ***"

Excellent use of blending tones, it's able to be funny, sad, and thrilling all at the same time and it makes it look so easy. I guess I just wanted more out of Sanjuro.

Filled with stunning action, great one liners and a refreshing blend of tones. The film manages to be funny, melancholic and action packed all at once. There’s hardly ever a dull moment and the film flies by. There’s so much sub text to the film, specifically the opening scene and the final scene can be interpreted in so many ways (no spoilers here but definitely look into it if you can, it’s extremely interesting.) Yojimbo is a film fan must ! Go watch it if you haven’t. Recommend me some films !  ***"

Witness for the Prosecution,1957,Billy Wilder, ★★★★½ ," Watching a Billy Wilder movie is an exercise in “Wait a minute wait a minute, you ain’t seen nothing yet.” “Witness for the Prosecution” is such a banger that it packs five of six of those somethings into just a five minute span. It’s a shame to call what Wilder does in his films “twists,’ given the hollowness of the word in cinema these days.

Probably zero but interesting to think about. ***"
Witness for the Prosecution,1957,Billy Wilder, ★★★★ ," The poster has it all wrong, this is Charles Laughton's film from start to finish. Billy Wilder does a great job of course, and keeps the pace well, but Laughton rules this world. The trial and who did it isn't the focus here, it's the character and dialog. ***"
Witness for the Prosecution,1957,Billy Wilder, ★★★★★ ," Witness for the Prosecution is the finest Courtroom drama I've ever seen. Perfect storytelling with a screenplay that is so engaging, witty and tight, I was hanging on to every word. A great blend of humour and a knockout performance from Charles Laughton. The direction is perfect, and the film becomes an instant favourite that I implore anyone to see.'Into the Wilder' ***"
Witness for the Prosecution,1957,Billy Wilder, ★★★★★ ," At the end of this there was a little announcement saying something along the lines of ""for the better enjoyment of your friends, please don't disclose the ending of this movie"" so that's basically all you need to know. Agatha Christie is god. ***"
Witness for the Prosecution,1957,Billy Wilder, ★★★★½ ," Courtroom drama does not get any better than this.Charles Laughton gives one of the best performances I have ever seen in this heart-pounding thrill ride that's directed expertly by a freak of nature who just doesn't miss. The way this thing unfolds is truly mind-blowing as it follows up surprise with surprise. It gripped me right until the very end.It's that special kind of film where as soon as I finish it, I'm on a massive film high and am going to be forcing those around me to watch it. Please watch it if you haven't.Wilder Ranked List ***"

8½,1963,Federico Fellini, ★★★★ ," Fables and control. A fascinating film about power in particular because Fellini himself is so open to showing off his own, those big sets, big crowds, the large choreography around Mastroianni, the occasional flights of fancy, few films scream so clearly how much its makers are allowed everything. For a film about the creative mind it is very tight, but those contradictions are part of what makes Fellini worth thinking about, there's a lot of method to his self-indulgence. ***"
8½,1963,Federico Fellini, ★★★★★ ," A dreamlike labyrinth of a movie, 8 1/2 is fun, elegant and personal in all the right ways. The film meanders around it's plot with flashbacks, dreams and real life which are constantly changing without warning but it's all done in such a masterful way by Fellini that it feels totally controlled. Impressively, 8 1/2 is both emotional and funny leaving it an enjoyable and relatively profound experience.My Top Films of the 1960s ***"

Life Is Beautiful,1997,Roberto Benigni, ★★★★ ," The brilliantly etched out character of Guido and the charmingly high spirited performance from Roberto Benigni forms the heart n soul of the drama. While the first hour treads as a romantic comedy with enjoyable slapsticks, the second shifts to the dark tragic events of Nazi concentration camp. Filled with some extremely touching and heartbreaking moments, the latter portions beautifully capture the love and sacrifice of a father to defend his child’s innocence. Though you know its far from reality and fictionalized, its executed in a deeply heartfelt and emotionally impactful manner. Highly recommended watch. ***"
Life Is Beautiful,1997,Roberto Benigni, ½ ," A truly horrible film; utterly false and cynical. I have a fairly low threshold for whimsy to begin with and to see it used in the context of industrialized mass murder is appalling. It may be possible to make a good comedy about the Final Solution but I don't know how you would do it, and neither did Benigni. ***"

An Elephant Sitting Still,2018,Hu Bo, ★★ ," 40/100A.V. Club review. Going against the herd again here, but miserabilism isn't any more appealing to me at epic length, and this is four solid hours of ""the world is shit."" (Also, I'm afraid I laughed at the ending, which reminded me of Gallo's original, hilariously ""symbolic"" ending for The Brown Bunny.) Genuinely sad that we won't get to see what Hu would have done next, though. ***"
An Elephant Sitting Still,2018,Hu Bo, ★★★½ ," hard to say what this film meant for hu bo, hard to say what it means to me, now... and it's certainly difficult to to openly revere art that is so deeply tied to its creator's suicide (last october, at age 29, shortly after finishing the film). but my god this is something. many troubling visions have been artistic ones, and hu bo's first and final film is, in many ways, incredibly weaved and constructed, within a world that remains stubbornly bleak. i do think this exhibits intent beyond exhausting grimness, though. idk, need more time with this but don't need a rewatch anytime soon. ***"
An Elephant Sitting Still,2018,Hu Bo, ★★★★★ ," Gray skies hang idly over a community with no refuge from the hopelessness that ties them to their monotonous existence. They say hope is resting in a faraway place, but will we make it there in time to discern its trumpeting lament of redemption or will it fall on deaf ears now expired from a life that became too much to withstand? ***"

An Elephant Sitting Still,2018,Hu Bo, ★★★★½ ," Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god. People wait everyday, but not all wait to get stabbed by forks altogether. The soul of post-rock laid across the withering bed, a life that was the complete opposite; Smothered by a universe lifetime's worth of nihilism. The crying barren that made me cough and made my throat thirsty, I still feel the quease in my stomach. Admittedly, something's telling me that I need to take it in even more, but what mattered was how much this meant for the director. May the warmth of peace find him.An excerpt from the trumpet of truth. ***"
An Elephant Sitting Still,2018,Hu Bo, ★★★★½ ," How do you critique a film that’s essentially a suicide note?Every frame of “An Elephant Sitting Still” feels brittle enough to crumble to ash in your hand. Filmed almost entirely in medium shots, the four-hour debut and final feature of director Hu Bo both lyricizes and minimizes the suffering of its characters. They inhabit a world of grey rubble; always falling apart in the blurry foreground.It’s as if the film is challenging its viewers to empathy: why should the plight of one person matter, when everything and everyone around them is in agony also? ***"
An Elephant Sitting Still,2018,Hu Bo, ★★★★½ ," Definitely the most strenuous, draining, joyless and dreadful film I’ve ever had the un-pleasure to watch. Unfortunately famed by the tragic death by suicide of its director Hu Bo just after he completed it, this movie inevitably comes out as the last testament of a man who clearly felt estranged with the world around him. And yet it weirdly doesn’t feel like a work of preposterous pessimism and misery porn, but more as a genuine but desperate attempt to find something that disproves that sort of view. ***"
An Elephant Sitting Still,2018,Hu Bo, ★★★★½ , The most magisterial and sensitive first feature I have ever seen. ***
An Elephant Sitting Still,2018,Hu Bo, ★★★★★ ," The entire time I was watching, I couldn’t stop thinking about the kid who gave his valedictorian’s speech from the year before I graduated. His speech was supposed to act as his suicide note. It is incomprehensibly emptying to hear, or in this case see, the last words of someone that wants to die.

The Great Dictator,1940,Charlie Chaplin, ★★★★½ ," Nothing less than a grand and startling picture; Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator is one of the best films involving Chaplin, even in spite of a somewhat disjointed narrative and some overlong stretches.

The Great Dictator,1940,Charlie Chaplin, ★★★★★ ," The Great Dictator (1940) is NOT Chaplin's funniest, but it's his BEST!Satire since untouched, historic circumstance make it such.Desperate plea for peace did not help the war cease.Five years of cruelty no comedy could heal.... Chaplin did a damn good try and that's The Great Dictator's main appeal! ***"
The Great Dictator,1940,Charlie Chaplin, ★★★★★ ," it’s a strong testament to charlie chaplin’s many talents that a talkie sits among one of his best. there’s something about chaplin films that give me a big stupid grin on my face the entire runtime. this case also applies, even with the more grounded political scenes dazzling me with their clever foresight. ***"
The Great Dictator,1940,Charlie Chaplin, ★★★★½ ," “The way of life can be free and beautiful. But we have lost the way.”Every Chaplin film I’ve seen before this one was silent. It’s a little weird watching him talk, and seeing all of the same kinds of gags with sound effects and talking as opposed to just music. Despite it being really different, this is easily one of my favorite Chaplin movies.The comedy and drama are blended together really well, and the satire is so smart and well made. This film was made 80 years ago but the speech at the end is still the best speech in film history. ***"

The Great Dictator,1940,Charlie Chaplin, ★★★★★ ," Charlie Chaplin truly was a master of his craft. Yet another hilarious entry in his filmography, but this one is possibly his most mature. Out of the three Chaplin films I’ve seen (City Lights, Modern Times, & The Great Dictator) this one is my least favourite, but that doesn’t take anything away from how amazing it is. The movie isn’t only a blast, but it also has some very important messages. This was a ballsy movie to make and it pays off. The final monologue given by Chaplin might be my favourite monologue of all time. ***"

The Great Dictator,1940,Charlie Chaplin, ★★★★★ ," Went Criterion shopping earlier and copped this mofo along with Badlands and It Happened One Night. I have already written a in depth review of this film, but I never noticed a few cool things about this like how good Pualette Goddard is in this. Her scenes are very impactful and her dialogue is well written if you listen closely. Besides the speech, there are many great moments like Charlie giving Paulette a makeover and Hynkel at the dinner scenes. Even the first like 15 minutes are fun to watch although I get Paths of Glory vibes for some odd reason. ***"

The Wages of Fear,1953,Henri-Georges Clouzot, ★★★★★ ," Henri-Georges Clouzot’s The Wages of Fear is an exceptionally gripping thriller about the corrupting consequences of capitalism, faintly camouflaged as an adventure movie. It’s based on a novel by Georges Arnaud and placed Clouzot on the international stage after it won the Palme d'Or at the 6th Cannes Film Festival. There’s a strong and active energy to its cinematic compositions, masterly provided by Armand Thirard (Les Diaboliques), which assists in this being a marvellously constructed politically soaked noir that’s overcrowded with anti-corporate views and opinions. ***"

The Wages of Fear,1953,Henri-Georges Clouzot, ★★★½ ," The Wages of Fear paints a sour, ironic picture of what the physical need for money brings out in people, both internally and externally. It messes with the head, plants heavy fear in the mind and makes us commit acts of meanness, even acts of crime against people, who - just mere minutes ago - were our best friends and buddies. The 'mud' scene shoved the ugly truth right into my face and was one of the most haunting cinematic moments I've witnessed. ***"
The Wages of Fear,1953,Henri-Georges Clouzot, ★★★★★ ," Cinematic tension at its finest! A bleak look at the courage of four men facing the threat of death at any given moment.

The Wages of Fear,1953,Henri-Georges Clouzot, ★★★★½ ," An exciting and suspenseful thriller which is slightly held back by its bloated runtime. One hour of setting up the main objective is just way too long for me however my word... is this film sensational from that point onwards. A great depiction of greed, subtle critique of capitalism and a showcase of human desperation. Thematically the two films that instantly came to mind are There Will Be Blood and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. Ending is unexpected but brilliant. ***"
The Wages of Fear,1953,Henri-Georges Clouzot, ★★★★★ ," It’s tense driving nitroglycerin through a scorching, rocky desert. It’s also surprisingly soul crushing. It snuck up on me at least.The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948) is an interesting comparison. Both are black and white morality tales about the destructive power of money, but this movie showcases power structures and capitalism, and Sierra Madre focuses on individual greed. In both cases the performances and cinematography are wonderful. ***"

The Wages of Fear,1953,Henri-Georges Clouzot, ★★★★★ ," Tensions of all kinds are explored: Emotional, physical (both in humans and in the trucks), economic, and of course the tension of us in the audience.

A couple of years later, I wrote a Scenic Routes column that, while specifically addressing our heroes' efforts to blow up a giant boulder blocking the road, does a fairly thorough job of anatomizing the movie's sweat-dotted suspense in general. (Rest of the review, along with everything else I write, available via ultra-cheap subscription. Seriously, it’s as little as $1 a month and for now that pays my rent.) ***"
The Wages of Fear,1953,Henri-Georges Clouzot, ★★★★★ ," there are two characters named mario and luigi that live together and that’s the only funny thing about this.i can’t believe how the original and remake are just as perfect as the other, but this premise just kicks so much ass. clouzot and friedkin both added their own touches to the nerve-pinching dread and they both work so damn well.this is what i like to call ‘makes my feet sweat’ cinema. ***"
The Wages of Fear,1953,Henri-Georges Clouzot, ★★★★½ , Characters are so focused on proving themselves to the point of creating an environment devoid of empathy. Sacrificing empathy for actions of strength rooted in a desire to desensitize people to violence. Violence hidden in the sacrificing of free will of workers within corporations. Corporations that will obtain wealth and power at the cost of people truly developing community among each without the need of violent actions. Characters become at odds with each other when everyone’s true desires eventually clash with one another. Characters trying to control life rather than trying to make the best of their limitations. A fear that cannot be avoided. ***
The Wages of Fear,1953,Henri-Georges Clouzot, ★★★★ ," After watching this my stomach was in knots and I was emotionally drained. I know others have said how tense and suspenseful this is, but I guess I didn't really believe I'd fall for it. I did. Hard. Charles Vanel is superb as Jo, who begins as a brash alpha-dog, but ends up switching roles with Yves Montand. ***"
The Wages of Fear,1953,Henri-Georges Clouzot, ★★★★½ ," Friedkin's reprise is so heavy on the dread and pyrotechnics that I was surprised how pleasurable so much of this is. Lots of time spent on character, classic men on a mission, slow burn action stuff. And then it gets on the road and every wide shot of a truck feels like a ticking time bomb. ***"

Still Walking,2008,Hirokazu Kore-eda, ★★★★½ , This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  The camera only moves in 2 scenes (that I remember) and the choice to move the camera in only those scenes is literally the most beautiful thing ever. The way Kore-eda captures space and location and uses that to tell the connection people have with each other cannot be replicated. Don't know how something so simple could feel like nothing I've ever seen before (besides Shoplifters obviously.) Last 10 minutes felt like I got hit by a bus!  ***
Still Walking,2008,Hirokazu Kore-eda, ★★★★½ ," In Still Walking, people don't change; their familial relationships won't change, or at least in any dramatic, fundamental sense. Avoidance always overcomes confrontation. As for communication, whether it's interpreted through coded words or physical action, silence will more than likely prevail. No closure is offered; resentments are left unvented, problems remain unsolved, but they are collectively acknowledged, and even understood by these characters. Kore-eda is so good at conveying affection through the minutiae of delicate gestures, expressions, and awkward interactions that he makes me long for a day to go back to my sweet home. I'm always like that. I'm always a little late. ***"
Still Walking,2008,Hirokazu Kore-eda, ★★★★ ," beautifully contained family drama that, by limiting itself to the unspoken affection and resentments that bleed into quiet interactions and awkward conversations, wonderfully observes how even when typical traditions erode knew ones are created as details of loved ones accumulate. ***"

Still Walking,2008,Hirokazu Kore-eda, ★★★★ ," Do you know that feeling of calm that washes over you during a cloudy Sunday afternoon? This move is the incarnation of that feeling. It is what nostalgia and solace would look like. It is silent, sincere, honest and nuanced. Still Walking proves that drama doesn’t always have to be a grief-stricken heavy scene to leave a lasting detrimental effect. Having experienced personal loss isn’t a requirement for you to relate to this realistic family portrait that gently makes you forget you are watching a movie, but simply a bystander looking in on a family dealing with loss.Sinegang weekly pick #2 by Hannah ***"

Still Walking,2008,Hirokazu Kore-eda, ★★★★½ ," Hirokazu Koreeda's (so far) masterpiece is so drenched in longing, loss, resentment and sadness that it's a wonder I love it so much. These elements, combined with the pace of the film, will likely mean you won't walk away from the film feeling too great. But you will see a master story-teller at work; and an honest, highly perceptive look at the ups and downs families experience, especially in times of reflection.While understated, Still Walking is populated by excellent acting and pitch-perfect direction that will almost certainly have you experiencing emotions you don't often get from films. ***"

Still Walking,2008,Hirokazu Kore-eda, ★★★★ ," My Criterion Challenge 2022: 6/52#32 Watch a film with a spine #500-600 (Spine #554) Still Walking is a profound family drama with natural-sounding dialogue and believable family conflicts. Kore-eda shows us an honest portrayal of human nature, family, and making decisions for yourself or being a parent going forward. It might be slow at times, but it still kept my interest until the very end. There’s much I can say except that it was a really good movie. ***"
Still Walking,2008,Hirokazu Kore-eda, ★★★★½ ," a beautiful soft-centered family dramathe simplicity and the verism of this film with its serene cinematography melted my heart. there are a few realistically relatable minutiae that i also completely love, most especially the complex familial connections that can really cause detrimental effects to every people being part of it.too personal & nostalgic ***"
Still Walking,2008,Hirokazu Kore-eda, ★★★★★ ," family traditions being reevaluated through the reveal and release of such deep resentment, as new traditions are born through the little ones running around in the garden, feeling the dew of the cherry blossoms, listening to the chirping of the cicadas. expertly depicts that sharp, dismissive feeling that festers inside when we have so much to say to someone but can never find the time or courage to. needed something to sooth my soul even if its emotionally taxing, so i hit the bullseye with this. perfect film. ***"

Paper Moon,1973,Peter Bogdanovich, ★★★★★ ," I can't think of many other films that stay heartwarming without being corny so gracefully. It is SO RARE to see a film that can make you laugh and cry without manipulating you into it - there is no swelling music here, no trademark Hollywood ""LOOK AT THIS! FEEL SOMETHING!"" close-ups.

Paper Moon,1973,Peter Bogdanovich, ★★★★½ ," The dialogues and characters here truly stood out and sparkled. The O’Neals (father & daughter in real life) were brilliant and wonderful. It delivered a lot of strong punches in the script with precision timing ~ amusing, endearing with sentimental moments. Paper Moon’s sharp as a tack and Tatum was smart as a whip. Tatum O’Neal was simply delightful in her role and she landed an Academy award from this, making her at that time the youngest one to win it. ***"

Nobody Knows,2004,Hirokazu Kore-eda, ★★★★★ ," ""I'm not allowed to be happy?'' How can your own flesh and blood say that???Koreeda channels Ozu aka the Master of Simplicity and pays tribute to Hitchcock in a slow burn thriller sequence which had me in knots.Had this been in the hands of another director it would have turned into loud and cliched consequences but instead it becomes a restrained,effective and thoughtful experience. Well deserved winner of Best Actor at the Cannes Film Festival! ***"
Nobody Knows,2004,Hirokazu Kore-eda, ★★★★ , the most depressing episode of Old Enough imaginable ***
Nobody Knows,2004,Hirokazu Kore-eda, ★★★★½ ," A painful bittersweet drama that’s brilliantly directed with some amazing storytelling. The subtle narrative never exploits the tragedy but instead makes us empathize for the kids throughout. Their innocent joy, little dreams and happiness, oblivious about the extremity of the circumstance they are in, makes it all the more harder to see them struggle, dragging one through a whole spectrum of emotions. It’s a tough slow paced mentally exhaustive watch with a 140 mins runtime, but if you can give in the time there is a lot to draw from it. Highly recommended watch. ***"

Nobody Knows,2004,Hirokazu Kore-eda, ★★★★★ ," Nobody Knows is a very painful film to watch and not because its bad, obviously it isn't. It's because of how real it is. Kore-eda is one of those special directors alongside Yasujiro Ozu and Edward Yang who makes films that don't feel like films, and just feel like life at its most raw and honest. This film really reminded how effective his style is. Quite possibly his greatest effort. ***"
Nobody Knows,2004,Hirokazu Kore-eda, ★★★★★ ," might be my favorite hirokazu kore-eda film thus farhow the genius direction, brilliant cinematography, and warm score all beautifully unfolded the foreshadowing and the inferred plot devices really overwhelms my mind with great wonder to an inexplicable extent—just simple plot with complex characterizations. this impeccably mirrors the forgotten corners of the society, and that just makes the entirety of it more piercing and tragic. what a picture-perfect film to nicely open my year (⊃｡•́‿•̀｡)⊃ ***"

Taste of Cherry,1997,Abbas Kiarostami, ★★★★★ , A film laden with grand ideas and themes - with a vision to match.

Then Kore-eda appears to deftly take every piece of us apart. He nimbly arranges and turns our hearts into punching bags before stealthily removing them from our chests forever. How do you survive through the second round, witnessing that long uninterrupted take again with Sakura Ando holding back and weeping for the children she tried to raise? Impossible. ***"

Werckmeister Harmonies,2000,Béla Tarr, ★★★ ," I...didn’t get it. 🙃 But that’s okay, because film is art and art is subjective, right? I just don’t see why this is so well-revered  when literally NOTHING happens for almost 2 and a half hours. Or why this was on effedupmovies?? But I committed to watching everything on that site, so here we are. I’m happy for those who found something of substance in this overlong slog, and I sympathize with those who didn’t. Either way, it’s certainly a movie that was made, so why not watch it and see, yeah? ***"
Werckmeister Harmonies,2000,Béla Tarr, ★★★★★ ," I cannot properly put into words all my feelings about this film but let it be known that I loved it very much and think this is an amazing feat of filmmaking. this made me feel very patriotic to be honest that this masterpiece of a film came from my motherland.I cannot wait to experience the rest of Béla Tarr's work, especially sátántangó, IM SO FUCKING EXCITED FOR SÁTÁNTANGÓ. ***"
Werckmeister Harmonies,2000,Béla Tarr, ★★★★½ ," Mesmerizing. Did not expect this to be as beautiful or emotionally powerful as it was, and I certainly did not expect to click with Tarr's style as much as I did. Will be hard getting this film out of my head anytime soon. What a masterpiece. ***"

Werckmeister Harmonies,2000,Béla Tarr, ★★★★★ ," Werckmeister Harmonies is simple. It’s 2 hours of tension, anger and frustration that culminates in an act of horrific violence. Directors typically use long tracking shots for immersion, to draw the audience in; that’s probably not new information for anyone that happens to be reading this review, but the way Tarr uses them draws the audience in, through the 39 shots in the 145 minutes of this film, even the most mundane actions are enthralling. After all, Werckmeister Harmonies isn’t necessarily focusing on that eruption of violence, but rather the quiet moments of humanity in this situation; making the violence all the more brutal and tragic. ***"

Werckmeister Harmonies,2000,Béla Tarr, ★★★★★ ," the atmosphere, the environment, it isn’t just another character. rather, it’s the character. chaos, darkness, evil...all of these make up society, as long as easily-malleable humans are involved. in some ways, it’s refreshing for this film to treat evil in such a cryptic, impenetrable (even hopeless) way. why does evil exist? it just does. fittingly, the final line of dialogue can also double as a suggestion for how to deal with living in, or, trying to survive in, such a world: “Take care of yourself.” ***"

The Hunt,2012,Thomas Vinterberg, ★★★★½ ," This is the day that I find out that Mads Mikkelsen is too good of an actor. I haven't seen many other films that have tackled such a serious subject in away The Hunt has. Some of the dialogue is absolutely heart-wrenching. Everything worked so well with each other. It's written and performed almost perfectly, in some parts, I forgot I was watching a film. ***"

The Hunt,2012,Thomas Vinterberg, ★★★½ , Been trying to think of what to say about this for a few days. On one hand I enjoyed it and thought it was pretty intense with good performances. The church scene was unreal. I watched the alternate ending and definitely thought that was how it would end lol. But on the other hand I don’t really care for the idea because how many people become brave enough to speak out about being raped or molested to be called a liar? I guess I’ve been struggling on what to think about this movie. ***

The Father,2020,Florian Zeller, ★★★★ ," What I Expected: a heartrending but quirky British movie about dealing with a loved one suffering from dementia.What I Found: One of the most unbearably tense and frightening films I've ever seen about *having* dementia. Really reminded me of Polanski's The Tenant, in that it mostly takes place in one apartment and truly made me feel like I was losing my mind. The ending of this movie will absolutely crush you if you're brave enough to experience it. Just give God Hopkins another Oscar. He destroyed me. ***"
The Father,2020,Florian Zeller, ★★★★★ , This movie ripped the heart from my chest and stomped on it. Ingenious use of film structure to put the viewer into the mind of an elderly man suffering from alzheimers. Anthony Hopkins is incredible. ***

The Father,2020,Florian Zeller, ★★★★ ," Florian Zeller's THE FATHER really surprised the hell out of me with how great it is. A skilfully crafted, totally compelling & emotionally devastating movie. Rarely has this subject matter been depicted so brilliantly, so honestly. The thing I liked most about it is that it's screenplay & editing structure perfectly align around the movie’s theme. Quite rare in film. Anthony Hopkins is incredible, he holds the audience in his grip - scene after scene is an exquisite masterclass of astonishing acting. He's still got it. ***"
The Father,2020,Florian Zeller, ★★★★ ," ""You'll feel alright in a moment, I promise.”I cannot overstate how incredible Anthony Hopkins is, I'm torn between wanting to rewatch his performance immediately and never seeing it again, it feels so raw, so true, so troubling and heartbreaking in a million different ways at once. Star ratings and words all feel so small, here ***"

Chinatown,1974,Roman Polanski, ★★★★½ ," The most interested I’ve been in a movie in a long time, I was sucked in with every scene. The screenplay does a fantastic job at giving you just enough, it’s as though each individual word was carefully thought out. No wonder it’s regarded as one of the best screenplays of all time! I’ve also decided to have the unpopular opinion that Jack Nicholson is one of my favorite actors! God damn is he good in this movie. Loved this! ***"

Chinatown,1974,Roman Polanski, ★★★★ , watching this on International Women’s Day was a mistake ***
Chinatown,1974,Roman Polanski, ★★★★★ ," I'm thinking Polanski can't have kept his hands to himself while directing this, because this is a very good film. I've looked into it, and when great directors keep their depravities in check, their art suffers. For a different but relevant example from the world of sports, just look at what happened to Tiger Woods. When he was abusing prescription medications and banging a multitude of willing cocktail waitresses, he was at the top of his game. And then, for the longest time, he gave that all up, during which he couldn't even sink a two-foot putt. ***"
Chinatown,1974,Roman Polanski, ★★★★★ , The first strand-type movie. ***
Chinatown,1974,Roman Polanski, ★★★★★ , can't really write a serious review about this cause everything has been already said. but it's a masterpiece. and probably one of the best screenplays ever. wish it wasn't directed by someone i hate. wish i could look as cool as jack nicholson when i'm smoking ***

Alien,1979,Ridley Scott, ★★★★★ ," Unclouded by conscience, remorse, or delusions of morality. ***"
Alien,1979,Ridley Scott, ★★★★★ ," The first words spoken in the entire film are about work contracts and wage inequality; the Nostromo is a cargo-carrying freighter instead of the more typical sci-fi fantasy of a starfighter or warship; and the ominously named ""The Company"" immediately deems the lives of its employees expendable when confronted with the value of an extraterrestrial biological weapon. The titular Alien of the film is just a metaphor for the insatiable, undying greed of capitalism. ***"

Brief Encounter,1945,David Lean, None ," “I wish… I wish.”David Lean’s films are governed by an agonizing repression ingrained in him by his puritanical upbringing, the echoes of which dominate this film in all respects but one. It’s unusual circular structure is bold for its time and bolder still for someone as adamantly formal as Lean. While very much a melodrama, it’s defining cathartic moment is echoed in countless romantic comedies to great effect. The Apartment, Manhattan, When Harry Met Sally and many more have Lean’s finest love story in their blood. ***"

Wings of Desire,1987,Wim Wenders, ★★★½ , imagine being such a simp you give up immortality smh ***
Wings of Desire,1987,Wim Wenders, ★★★★★ ," Such a life-affirming and touching film. Its marvelous free-flowing camera work that becomes an angel-like character itself, its effective use of color, time and the divided city of Berlin, the emotionally evoking soundtrack, the contrast of the adult's mundane or existentialistic thoughts to children's enthusiasm, and its wonderful performances and cameos makes this such a mesmerizing experience capturing both the happy and miserable aspects of life in a meditative and reflective way. It's a nearly plotless and slow-paced film, but it flows like poetry in motion, a love letter to the joy of life. I love it. I'm so glad I saw this in the theatre. ***"

Wings of Desire,1987,Wim Wenders, ★★★★ ," The beautiful camerawork really is like a character in its own right, travelling seamlessly through faces and settings, revealing so much without judgment or contempt. It’s perhaps the most serene I’ve ever felt while watching a film, like I was flying over Berlin myself, peering over strangers’ shoulders and experiencing the city through every single person who had travelled in these paths. 4.2/5 ***"
Wings of Desire,1987,Wim Wenders, None , one of the most gorgeous ***
Wings of Desire,1987,Wim Wenders, ★★★★ ," Depending on your mood, this movie is either fantastic or extremely tiresome. In the right mood this is an existential movie that speaks very deeply about the sheer beauty of our ever going existence; especially when it comes to love being expressed physically and mentally. I go through this on a daily basis so this is right up my alley ***"
Wings of Desire,1987,Wim Wenders, None ," ""There's an old joke - um... two elderly women are at a Catskill mountain resort, and one of 'em says, 'Boy, the food at this place is really terrible.' The other one says, 'Yeah, I know; and such small portions.' Well, that's essentially how I feel about life - full of loneliness, and misery, and suffering, and unhappiness, and it's all over much too quickly."" ***"
Wings of Desire,1987,Wim Wenders, ★★★★★ ," I think about what is withheld throughout this film. Color is withheld from the viewer, so when it comes on the screen, it stuns. Nothing is withheld from the angels, so everything is withheld from the angels. Nothing is withheld from the constantly roaming camera, but the roaming is withholding what’s been left behind.  I didn’t even know closeups were being withheld, until I saw those closeups at the end of the film. The absence throws the presence into stark relief, and trains my eyes to search for what I might be missing. ***"

Wings of Desire,1987,Wim Wenders, ★★ ," I really wanted to like this, and at least on a technical level I can admire the artistry, but this was astonishingly a drag to watch. I felt nothing.I think this is becoming a personal trend. Magical realism just doesn't sit with me. ***"

Wings of Desire,1987,Wim Wenders, ★★★★ ," “Why am I me, and why not you? Why am I here, and why not there? When did time begin, and where does space end? Isn't life under the sun just a dream? Isn't what I see, hear, and smell just the mirage of a world before the world? Does evil actually exist, and are there people who are really evil? How can it be that I, who am I, wasn't before I was, and that sometime I, the one I am, no longer will be the one I am?”what a gorgeous film ***"
Wings of Desire,1987,Wim Wenders, ★★★★½ , Wim Wenders is a wonder ***
Wings of Desire,1987,Wim Wenders, ★★★★½ , It’s very hard to say anything of substance about this but it feels like a dream in the best way. Extraordinarily dense in the best way with internal logic so sound yet beautifully unexplained. I can see the influence it had on Barbie and understand why it’s on the watchlist. ***

The Departed,2006,Martin Scorsese, ★★★★★ ," 95A sweltering, vulgar monstrosity of off-the-rails catholicism and pent-up masculine entrapment. Scorsese throws everything at the wall to see what sticks in order to get an interesting angle on what ultimately amounts to a bunch of Bostonians saying 'microprocessor' and 'fuck'. The ensemble cast is to die for and they're yelling constantly, it's great! A fiery smorgasbord of nasty identity crises and angry men. ***"

Pather Panchali,1955,Satyajit Ray, ★★★★½ ," Every once in awhile there comes a film that I’ll watch that reminds me why cinema, and more importantly foreign cinema, is so important to the world. Cinema is global, it is not bound by international borders, not hindered by cultural differences, and not diminished by language barriers. It teaches us that regardless of the time period, the color of our skin, the countries of origin, and the cultural background, we are all human, and that is an undeniably collective experience.Pather Panchali is that film for me.9.2 / 10 ***"

Pather Panchali,1955,Satyajit Ray, ★★★★★ ," This is my first Ray and WOW. If you know me guys I normally do write long thoughts on the film I just saw. But right now I've no words. Absolutely beautiful film with great music, direction, mesmerizing performances and that brilliant sound design and cinematography and that top shots which were used so well. The ending necklace and ""after train"" Scene is really hitting me hard. Wow. Simplicity at its best. Great films never ages. Predictable but yea THIS IS CINEMA™. 🎬 ***"
Pather Panchali,1955,Satyajit Ray, ★★★★★ ," Found myself ambushed and overwhelmed by  emotion on this rewatch during, of all moments, the water striders scene. And then, there were the shots of the lily pads being whipped up by the wind. The unbearable beauty and heartache of it all, captured, somehow, in those skating bugs and those wet leaves, curling over upon themselves. It’s been 24 hours, and I still haven’t fully recovered. ***"
Pather Panchali,1955,Satyajit Ray, ★★ ," Punishing pacing issues abound in this cyclical feature. Coupled with flat performances and a manipulative hollowness that is reflected in both characters and story, I wasn't able to connect with this at all. It looks great, with cinematography that makes the most of the film's spartan iconography. It's also contextually remarkable in spite of itself. I'd even say there's a great short in this, buried under the film's 10,000 instances of people looking for and eating fruit. But the excess minutes around it render this yarn frustratingly inert as a viewing experience.Scavenger Hunt 70 - Watch a film from India. ***"
Pather Panchali,1955,Satyajit Ray, ★★★★★ ," “Not to have seen the cinema of Ray means existing in the world without seeing the sun or the moon”. - Akira KurosawaA lyrical ode to idyllic tapestries of the human soul. Ray shows the joys which can be derived from the simple pleasures of life which we so often take for granted. It may seem trivial to us, but those who are less fortunate appreciate their real worth. One of those endings where I cried like a baby. ***"

Pather Panchali,1955,Satyajit Ray, ★★★★★ ," The most impressive cinematic debut ever. Ray harnesses the raw emotion of the Italian neo-realists to craft his own homegrown slice of docu-fiction. A unique visual language, intertwined realism and idealism, incredibly nuanced black and white photography. A real triumph. ***"

Pather Panchali,1955,Satyajit Ray, ★★★★★ ," Rewatching this makes me think any country could benefit from some sort of cinematic neorealist movement, no matter how small. The way this strips things down to the bare minimum of the human experience (of course kind of forced into it because of the subject matter but still) makes for exactly the kind of cinematic poetry that the preceding movement of ""poetic realism"" promised us back in the 1930s. Undoubtedly one of the greatest of all time. ***"
Landscape in the Mist,1988,Theo Angelopoulos, ★★★★★ ," Watching films like Landscape in the Mist is the main reason why I love this site so much. I don't remember the exact circumstances that led to my viewing of this film, but I know that without Letterboxd I never in a quadrillion years would of ever discovered that this film, or any similar to it (such as Tarkovsky's films), even existed.

Landscape in the Mist,1988,Theo Angelopoulos, ★★★★★ ," Life, as presented through the journey of two children.An honest, heartbreaking and beautiful odyssey of hope and realization, innocence and reality, through an endless landscape of mist leading to nowhere, and perhaps everywhere at the same time.Theo Angelopoulos is a visual and emotional master, an artist that deserves more recognition from his symbolic language to hypnotic camerawork, every frame instills a certain mood and feeling making for a moving experience that is impossible to forget. ***"
Landscape in the Mist,1988,Theo Angelopoulos, ★★★★★ ," My favourite Angelopoulos film. The last film of Angelopoulos Trilogy of Silence is also his most sublime one. It’s an enormously melancholy tale, Angelopolous using every cinematic tool at his disposal to make the viewer really feel for these children. The tragedy of the film lies in the innocence with which two kids see the world that they are traveling alone. There are many things that they don’t understand and they suffer from cruelties in the search for an ideal that may not even exist. Culminating in some truly tragic scenes, Landscape in the Mist is absolutely devastating. ***"

Landscape in the Mist,1988,Theo Angelopoulos, ★★★★ ," An odyssey of two fatherless children: mythology, culture, and history converge through allegorical articulations within a profound ocean full of not just beauty and lyricism but also calamity and barbarism.

The Sacrifice,1986,Andrei Tarkovsky, ★★★★ ," ""I studied philosophy, history of religion, aesthetics. And ended up putting myself in chains. Of my own free will."" -Alexander, - Andrei Tarkovsky Ranked: boxd.it/cVD0iI guess that Cinematography really does matter.This a beautiful and interesting film about an incredibly tense topic that creeps me out... nuclear fallout. The script is thought-provoking and grounded and I enjoyed it, even though I must admit that I was occasionally bored. The real star here is the camerawork, which is godly and needs to be seen by more people. Definitely recommended. ***"

The Sacrifice,1986,Andrei Tarkovsky, ★★★ , It’s a shame when I decide to put on a Tarkovsky when I’m not feeling very Tarkovskyish. Probably need to try this again but the trouble is I don’t know when that will be ***

The Sacrifice,1986,Andrei Tarkovsky, ★★★★★ ," “My purpose is to make films that will help people to live, even if they sometimes cause unhappiness.” — Andrei Tarkovsky on the set of The Sacrifice, 1986. Andrei Tarkovsky com certeza é um dos meus diretores e roteiristas favoritos do mundo todo. Nem com todas as expressões e palavras existentes no vocabulário eu seria capaz de expressar o que esse filme foi pra mim. A mais bela carta de despedida que alguém poderia deixar a este mundo e ao seu filho. Obrigada por tanto! ***"
The Sacrifice,1986,Andrei Tarkovsky, ★★★★★ ," Powerful and moving stuff right here. While obviously a Tarkovsky film, there is a heavy Bergman influence hanging overhead. It’s very straight forward and singularly focused, and that’s what I like about it. Because it’s still as complex and rich with depth like his other works, but it’s easier to digest. Simultaneously a film praising devotion to God, and damning him too. Love it ***"
The Sacrifice,1986,Andrei Tarkovsky, ★★★★½ ," that final burning house shot might be the greatest shot. ever. how does andrei do it, i cant comprehend his genius. ***"
The Sacrifice,1986,Andrei Tarkovsky, ★★★★★ , “…Sin is that which is unnecessary…”…. “If only we could stop fearing death “ ***
The Sacrifice,1986,Andrei Tarkovsky, ★★★½ , Shut Up Little Man ***
The Sacrifice,1986,Andrei Tarkovsky, ★★★★½ ," What a high note to end your career. Knowing this was Tarkovsky’s last film before he died a few months after its release gives it a whole new layer. This man gave his life to cinema. I may not have loved all of his movies (I still can’t get around Mirror, sorry), but he surely became one of my favorite filmmakers. That being said, my next binge will probably be the Alvin and the Chipmunks franchise because man, this was exhausting. ***"
The Sacrifice,1986,Andrei Tarkovsky, ★★★★★ ," Tarkosvsky posee un rigor inimitable y una sustancia intelectual tan soberbia que sin importar lo altas que estén situadas las expectativas, consigue astutamente sobrepasarlas. Esta pieza somete al espectador a su cadencia, su brutal desapego y su terror existencial con una fineza cruda y contundente que consigue decir, en algunas secuencias, más de lo que algunos han logrado trasmitir en filmografías enteras. Es paranoica, desesperanzadora, dura. Es melancólica y muy auto consciente. No le sobra un plano, un diálogo, ni un ápice de intención. Es, a falta de una palabra mejor, excepcional. ***"
The Sacrifice,1986,Andrei Tarkovsky, ★★★★★ ," It took me a long time, but I finally found my favorite Tarkovsky. ***"
The Sacrifice,1986,Andrei Tarkovsky, ★★★★½ ," This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  We live, we have our ups and downs.We wait for something.We hope, we lose hope,we move closer to death. Finally, we dieand are born again.But we remember nothing.~~& The climax is a long shot in which Alexander burns his house and his possessions. (like in the poster) This sequence is frustrating, scary, unsettling, beautiful, moving, mysterious, profound. As well one of the most memorable ending I've seen.  ***"
The Sacrifice,1986,Andrei Tarkovsky, ★★★★★ ," So powerful, I think this would work great as an introduction to Tarkovsky's films and maybe even for someone getting into Bergman. The directing and long shots are jaw-dropping and the themes explored leave so much open to discuss. I'm sure that I don't fully understand my thoughts on this now so I'm not gonna say too much, but I look forward to a rewatch. ***"

Tampopo,1985,Jūzō Itami, None , deliciously erotic. my kink is not naughty food sex or oysters or sexy nurses though. my kink is a group of straight men helping a single mom open a successful business and then driving away without asking for anything in return. ***
Tampopo,1985,Jūzō Itami, ★★★★★ ," ""Apologize to the pork.""One of the most erotic movies of all time. If only there were an English word that meant horny and hungry at the same time. In the decade or so since I saw this last, I forgot about all the surreal digressions from the main plot: the secret ingredients that make this movie so damn fun and delicious. (Except for that egg yolk scene. Gross.) ***"

Tampopo,1985,Jūzō Itami, ★★★★★ ," Fourth watch, fourth review, I’ve nearly run out of things to stay. Still as incredible and enjoyable as ever. Constructed with such overt love for both film and food. Imbued with a genuine belief in the good in people and an even more powerful belief that people will be compelled to use their good to help others unlock their own. To believe in someone and to believe that someone believes in you are both superpowers that can change the world. Or at least a ramen shop. ***"

All That Jazz,1979,Bob Fosse, ★★★★★ ," This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.

All That Jazz,1979,Bob Fosse, ★★★★★ ," Unparalleled cinematic autobiography, one that deconstructs its maker’s demons with exhilarating honesty while reimagining each phase of his screen career as an abstract and increasingly musical death rattle. When the exuberant showmanship of Sweet Charity finally rears its head for the finale, what happens next is as transcendent as anything one could possibly hope to see in a film. The stage, the ensemble, the beats, the cuts, the microphones as drumsticks: Fosse thought of everything. This is a God dream. ***"

Modern Times,1936,Charlie Chaplin, ★★★★★ ," Even though it's not a completely silent movie, it sure proves dialogue is sometimes completely unnecessary.Sheer genius. ***"
Modern Times,1936,Charlie Chaplin, ★★★★ , why is he chasing women with wrenches. what kinda slumber party massacre shit is this ***
Modern Times,1936,Charlie Chaplin, ★★★★★ ," The title of Modern Times holds a double meaning to the film. It comments on living during the depression-era, but it also comments on Charlie Chaplin’s career during the transition of talkies in cinema. Dropping this silent masterpiece when the silent-era was in the past and where the modern times had talkies dominating the theaters, Chaplin proved to the people that silent films weren’t just a technological constraint in the medium — they held unique merits of storytelling that deem them both viable and irreplaceable. ***"

Modern Times,1936,Charlie Chaplin, ★★★★★ ," nobody baby but you and me.for me, Modern Times represents some firsts: my first feature length film from the silent era, first Chaplin etc., so this is a pretty big milestone for me in my cinematic education. the cherry on top is that even if i had seen every other silent film in existence, i would come to the exact same conclusion: that this is one of the most magical things i've ever seen. i may be hard pressed to find any film that juggles reflections of poverty and economic depression so well with timeless comedy. its paradise. ***"

Modern Times,1936,Charlie Chaplin, ★★★★½ ," So there are unemployed people begging for work to be able to put bread on their table, and those who have work are enslaved and can't even have a descent lunch break?And a man prefers to be jail in peace rather than a fucked up society?Man! This movie was waaaayyyy ahead of its time.And a brilliant comedy can be awefully tragic ***"
Modern Times,1936,Charlie Chaplin, ★★★★ ," - 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die - He was such a master at what he did. He had a perfect character that had a funny walk, funny looks and always made a fool out of himself. He found something that worked and went with it. More often than not, it was very successful. With the direction/choreography, synced with the music, it gave off a certain energy and a certain rhythm to the film that very few other people can do. I can't imagine there will ever be someone who will make films as he did. ***"
Modern Times,1936,Charlie Chaplin, ★★★★ ," People will be like 'it was so much better back in the old days' and with Chaplin's works, I'm like yes, yes it actually kinda was! Mainly because we go forward by 100 years and anyone can operate a camera and share their creative expression with the world, even if they shouldn't due to a callous and hubris temperament, and by anyone I mean that of Jake Paul. ***"

The Young Girls of Rochefort,1967,Jacques Demy, ★★★★½ ," This is one of those times I desperately wish I spoke French, because the ability to take in the beautiful images on screen without having to constantly draw your eyes to the subtitles almost seems like a privilege. Despite this small hindrance in an otherwise magical viewing experience, I loved every minute of Young Girls. It was everything I wanted The Umbrellas of Cherbourg to be, and much, much more. I love the sensation of being transported into a colorful, sun-soaked dream, one that contrasts so sharply to this gray, dull September afternoon. I’m so happy I finally watched this. ***"

Terminator 2: Judgment Day,1991,James Cameron, ★★★★★ ," James Camerons' 1991 iconic sci-fi epic could perhaps be considered one of the best and most influential movies of its genre. Non-stop action, futuristic violence intertwined with parent issues, create an astoundingly thrilling and absorbingly enthralling actuality, in which the viewers will almost certainly get gulped into. Even when not a fan of action, Judgment Day will impress you with how advanced, and substantially entertaining it is. It imagines things you wouldn't even be likely to dream and gets these sequences onscreen with a flawlessness that is outstanding.EDIT: unfortunately Letterboxd temporary logged me out, and unfollowed everyone I used to follow, I will be refollowing as many people as I can. ***"

Red Beard,1965,Akira Kurosawa, ★★★★★ ," Just gonna come right out and say it...better than ‘Seven Samurai’. This had my attention from beginning to end. Everything about it was flawless, not to mention how moved I was by the end. It tackles the idea of death as well as mental health and the morals surrounding that (and much more), and I’m probably gonna remember what I learned from this film forever. I can’t believe I’m saying this about a 3 hour long black&white film from the 60s but I’m PROBABLY gonna watch it again soon. Loved it. ***"
Red Beard,1965,Akira Kurosawa, ★★★★ ," Whenever Kurosawa chose to explore humanitarian and existential themes, he always managed to strike the right chord, making it a powerful life affirming experience. Even though he deals with tragic and darkest of moments, the drama always stays hopeful, brimming with humanity and life. The performances from both Toshiro Mifune and Yuzo Kayama were effective and impactful. A highly recommended watch. ***"
Red Beard,1965,Akira Kurosawa, ★★★★★ ," Masterful wide-screen poorhouse hospital melodrama. A sprawling, serialized novel in five short story acts. Painted in broad, audience pleasing, strokes. Kurosawa’s ethos is strong, his moral insistences comforting, the characters are uncomplicated, the weather an emotion, and the images often staggering. (The prayer bell motif throughout Sahachi's story is heart bursting.) But this also marks so many endings for the director. His last black and white film, his last time working with Mifune, the end of his great productive era, and the last of the Kurosawa hero... that gruff and hard natured man who is centered entirely on the betterment of all mankind. ***"

Red Beard,1965,Akira Kurosawa, None ," Kurosawa's film is beautifully made, with striking black-and-white cinematography, an excellent sense of time and locale.  This film, better than so many which make the same attempt, communicates the need for human understanding and care for the unfortunate. By exploiting the arrogance and ignorance of the self-centered doctor, Kurosawa finally explains in beautiful scenes with heart-wrenching acting, why we should care about others. ***"
Red Beard,1965,Akira Kurosawa, ★★★★½ ," A very underappreciated film from Kurosawa. I felt so many emotions throughout the entire 3 hour runtime, didn't expect the film to move me like this at all. ***"

Red Beard,1965,Akira Kurosawa, ★★★★½ ," Red Beard is a wonderful film about compassion, full of both sadness and warmth. The film also represents the end of a phase of Kurosawa’s life: his last Toshiro Mifune collaboration and the last film before his mental state deteriorated.I do think Yasumoto made a big mistake at the end though. Personal physician to the Shogun! How can you pass up that opportunity??? ***"
Red Beard,1965,Akira Kurosawa, ★★★★ , I’ve been stroking my beard wrong this whole time ***
Red Beard,1965,Akira Kurosawa, ★★★★ ," Akira Kurosawa offers another one of his perceptive social and character-based dramas with ""Red Beard,"" the story of a young physician and his wise mentor. The work is broad, extensive, and full of characters, but its heart beats specifically and with focus through the glower of Toshiro Mifune's patient protagonist. Red Beard drives the drama, and Kurosawa's lens captures both the broad strokes of the film's human themes and expectedly dynamic compositions. The master, once again, offers a fine film and an involving portrait of hearts, souls, and minds in life's motion. ***"
Red Beard,1965,Akira Kurosawa, ★★★★½ ," WINTER ""HIGH ART"" MARATHON 3.0 #85Just as emotionally resonant as Ikiru and almost as long as Seven Samurai. What a picture. It might be long and slowly paced, but it rewards you for your patience. By the end, you really feel like you've gotten to know the people who live in this run-down village. Yet another one of his films that I love now, but I have a feeling will get raised to a 5 the next time I come back to it. ***"
Red Beard,1965,Akira Kurosawa, ★★★★½ ," A pretty amazing Kurosawa film that I don’t see as many people talk about. This film is 3 hours long, but just like his other 3 hour epics like Seven Samurai and Kagemusha, you barely feel the runtime. Red Beard is easily his most calm film. This is a film about kindness, compassion, the human condition, etc. I recommend it.Japanuary 2022 🇯🇵Akira Kurosawa Ranked  ***"

Red Beard,1965,Akira Kurosawa, ★★★★ ," What is the greatest director-actor duo?Martin Scorsese and Robert DeNiro?Quentin Tarantino and Samuel L. Jackson?No.The answer is Akira Kurosawa and Toshirô Mifune.Mifune really was the most badass actor ever. He has such a commanding presence in this movie, even if he's not in it as much as I might have hoped.Even when he plays a doctor, he can still beat up a group of guys.It's not one of my favorite Kurosawa movies (It's three hour runtime doesn't move as smoothly as in Seven Samurai), but a still a great movie. ***"

Funeral Parade of Roses,1969,Toshio Matsumoto, ★★★★★ , They just don’t make films like this anymore ***
Funeral Parade of Roses,1969,Toshio Matsumoto, ★★★★★ ," Funeral Parade of Roses is a lot of things – experimental, idiosyncratic, progressive, intersectional. However, perhaps most of all, it is timeless. Director Toshio Matsumoto captures 1960s Japan with such specificity and intention, guiding us beyond whatever we usually see on a surface level. Many films explore identity; few do so as thoughtfully and impressively as this. And with society at large becoming increasingly polarized, it will only grow to be more relevant than it already is. ***"

The Third Man,1949,Carol Reed, ★★★★★ ," It’s all about the atmosphere for me, the way this plays with light, shadows, and off-kilter angles so effectively makes those evocative shots of dark alleys, wet cobblestone streets, and underground sewers feel instantly iconic. Plus you will never get the score out of your head! ***"
The Third Man,1949,Carol Reed, ★★★★ , Evil hands over the city. As far as film goes the perfect realization of Greene sense of damnnation as it extends through Vienna and post war Europe itself. One of those movies where every part just clicks. It is only limited a light by Greene's conception of Cotten's writer been a little thin to quite sustain Reed's moral inquiry. It is still pretty fun how much Welles dominates when his performance is really one great scene and a lot of scattered silent shots. ***

The Third Man,1949,Carol Reed, ★★★★½ ," Dwindling in the cavities of observation, apparitions lurk through alley and liminal existence rehearsing their virulence. A distant sound, it reverberates from cobble to cobble, twilight in it's essence - impending in it's fate. Every shadow is insidious, dancing in it's artifice, conversing of it's ineffable enigma. Where everything else seems transient, these vessels remain indelible; festering on the detritus of memories and anguish gone in their capacity. Emerging, these spectres of veiled secrets are no different to those that dwell in light - to all be lucidly manifesting in a lifeless and immoral world, existing in the endurance of hatred. ***"
The Third Man,1949,Carol Reed, ★★★★★ ," It scares me how much all of this nihilism resonated with me.Also, how is every single shot of this film so perfect?!EDIT: it's been 10 days and I can't stop thinking about this movie, so changing the rating to a perfect score. ***"

The Night of the Hunter,1955,Charles Laughton, ★★★★½ ," went to a mystery screening tonight and when the opening credits started playing, i couldn't contain my excitement. this works on so many levels for so many reasons, even the occasional hokeyness adds a new layer to the sickly dark humor. but it's the cinematography and unusual directing that kicks this up a notch, and as a result, it transcendsthis might be one of the best films ever made""i can feel myself gettin' awful mad. i'm out of patience, children. i'm coming to find you now."" ***"
The Night of the Hunter,1955,Charles Laughton, ★★★★½ , i love the expressionist style — the use of shadows makes everything scarier than it already is. it’s a damn shame that charles laughton never made another film because he is an insanely talented director. also has lemony snicket/daniel handler ever cited night of the hunter as an influence for a series of unfortunate events because the plot is like...the same. ***
The Night of the Hunter,1955,Charles Laughton, ★★★★½ ," The year is 1955. I'm in a movie theater watching The Night of the Hunter. I keep shouting ""WHAT INTERESTING BIRTHMARKS!"" whenever Mitchum's LOVE/HATE knuckle tattoos are shown. Eventually an usher tapes a popcorn tub to my face as a makeshift muzzle. The crowd cheers when he does this. The next time the knuckle tattoos are shown, I attempt to shout again. The popcorn tub doesn't really do anything to stop the noise. If anything it's a little louder now. Everyone groans. The usher wails in agony. And me? I'm simply enjoying the wonderful smell of popcorn. And hidden inside the popcorn tub, I'm smiling. ***"

The Night of the Hunter,1955,Charles Laughton, None ," So apparently Charles Laughton made this movie and then was just done. I guess I get it, he wanted to go out on a really high note. But I can’t help but think him selfish. If you can make one great movie you’ve probably got three or four more decent ones in there. Can’t imagine he had a lot of other stuff going on. The 50s seem like they were a pretty boring time. But I guess that’s none of my business... ***"
The Night of the Hunter,1955,Charles Laughton, None ," On this viewing I was very moved by the Lillian Gish character. She is textured. She carries deep wounds, and is obviously a bit of a weirdo, but by the end of the movie you have to admit that she's a good person. She earns the kids' love and trust. She fundamentally respects them, and is willing to put in heroic work to protect them. She'll stay out on the porch with her shotgun all night to make sure Mitchum can't get them.The ending is jarringly pat and upbeat, but if viewed from a certain angle feels a bit like the end of Blue Velvet. ***"

The Night of the Hunter,1955,Charles Laughton, ★★★★½ ," It absolutely blows my mind that this movie was panned by critics and audiences, and (probably) as a result Charles Laughton never made another film. It's also insane how creepy Robert Mitchum is here, and this whole ""serial killer preacher"" story is a wild concept. The film lives on through so many other works though, as it has been inspiring filmmakers for decades. I mean, can you watch this and NOT immediately think of the Coen brothers?? ***"
The Night of the Hunter,1955,Charles Laughton, ★★★★★ ," Gothic fairytale cinema. This film more than any other taught me that boogeymen are real so always be careful who you trust.

To Be or Not to Be,1942,Ernst Lubitsch, ★★★★½ ," One of the best anti-war satires I've ever seen. Not only a film of vast importance, but one that stands the test of time with its comic tone and intense ordeals. The comedy didn't just hit in a ""funny for the era"" kind of way, but in a laugh-out-loud and timeless way. Comic timing unlike anything I've seen in a long time. A film that manages to strike the perfect balance between humour and the gravity of the situation at the time of its release. ***"

I kind of zoned out and the film just lost me after a certain point.A rewatch might help down the line definitely, and for the most part I did like it a lot, Fellini's direction is phenomenal and Marcello's performance is also incredible, but for now...idk. ***"
La Dolce Vita,1960,Federico Fellini, ★★★★ ," Felllni's orgy: party until there's nothing left, but make sure the debauchery is exciting and alluring as movie magic can make it. Very much a small town's boy idea of Sodom and Gomorrah, if his imagination has long been colonized by the wicked. ***"
La Dolce Vita,1960,Federico Fellini, ★★★★½ ," In the city. Quotidian emptiness. In the city.Turning over each rock, scouring every surface, peering down the endless, dimly lit alleyways… what do you find? Fickle banalities.Or contrived excitement, ripe for exploitation, subject to the whims of mammalian malaise.An angel’s soft touch can turn night into day.Men and women, their glamorous fraudulence, malleably meager, like fake plastic dolls. Women and men, wearing a smile, fixed up with everything, and nothing at all.Some who seem happy may suddenly snap.And all the while, pretty lovers dance in circles under the hanging gaze of God Himself. ***"

La Dolce Vita,1960,Federico Fellini, ★★★★ ," The allure of decay. Greatest movie De Mille never made. Much closer to L'Avventura than either movie fans would usually accept, although Fellini's grotesque comedown is arguably more honest if populist. Perhaps too much and certainly overplayed (but that is not the film's fault), but most of the parts remain great on themselves. ***"
La Dolce Vita,1960,Federico Fellini, ★★★★½ ," Fellini was amazing, Mastroianni was an incredible actor, this has some of the most beautiful shot compositions I’ve ever seen and it has become one of my favourite films. I already want to rewatch it. ***"
La Dolce Vita,1960,Federico Fellini, ★★★★★ ," ""Our parties are famous for being first-class funerals.""The impossible happened...2001: A Space Odyssey has been dethroned for me. I'll always, always, always treasure it dearly, but after revisiting La Dolce Vita today I felt a completely new experience with cinema. I can't quite describe it, but it just gave me everything and then some. I feel revitalized yet completely drained, overwhelmed in the most psychologically fulfilling way possible with a uniquely enigmatic love. I hope I'll be able to write in detail about this film soon but as of right now, I’m unbelievably floored with just how true this rings to life. ***"

Z,1969,Costa-Gavras, ★★★★½ ," This was insane, a genuine masterpiece. The editing, shot composition, script, the score and cinematography were flawless. Easily the best political thriller I’ve ever seen, watching the conspiracy unravel and seeing the power of corruption within a political system was astonishing. A distinct breakdown of a totalitarian government, incredible film. ***"

Z,1969,Costa-Gavras, ★★★★½ , This movie is more than 50 year old and still relevant to rhis day. With political divides that are leading down insane violence. That said a brilliant film but for me depressing and difficult to watch. Costa Gavras was the king of political filmmaking and this was his Masterpiece. ***
Z,1969,Costa-Gavras, ★★★★½ , Political perfection ***
Z,1969,Costa-Gavras, ★★★★½ ," So massive and vital and human, so much fun to watch and just as much fun to think about. Every piece serves the bigger picture and stands fully-formed on its own. You can see how so many directors since have taken from this, and how modern it still seems. Forever relevant filmmaking in every sense. Z rules. ***"
Z,1969,Costa-Gavras, ★★★½ , It's pretty awesome to see a movie go so in-depth into political paranoia years before American movies would start doing the same thing because of Watergate. It's a satisfyingly dense movie that scratches the same itch that watching true crime documentaries do. Added to THE 60s ***
Z,1969,Costa-Gavras, ★★★★★ ," I watched Costa-Gavras' 1967 effort ""Shock Troops"" back in June, so I was somewhat prepared for ""Z""—I recognized the director's flair for kinetic violence and the way his camera often seems untethered by gravity, either floating over proceedings like an omniscient presence or dramatically pushing in on key moments—but was still taken aback by the film's underlying streak of deadpan humor. The only film I might readily compare it to is a version of ""The Battle of Algiers"" where irony and folly abound. ***"
Z,1969,Costa-Gavras, ★★★★★ ," Absolutely thrilling, chilling and essential. The way this film unfolds is enthralling as every character is viciously fleshed out, pulled in and out of the narrative, while the editing makes superb use of its own limits to create a relentless narrative feature that remains tragically relevant more than half a century after its release. Its sense of immediacy, style and forceful storytelling has no comparison. Z should be required viewing, especially by those interested in pursuing a career in politics. The ending left me cold and sitting there spellbound. ***"
Z,1969,Costa-Gavras, None ," Z is a political thriller that meets crime thriller and just a touch of psychological drama. The storyline for this picture is interesting but a bit long and could have been paced better. Perhaps I was too cynical to begin with, but nothing was really shocking after the introduction and the film was too slow to get to the point. Powerful message about fragility and mistakes of democacy, splendid hommage to the truth. ***"
Z,1969,Costa-Gavras, ★★★½ ," 66/100Second viewing, last seen 1992. Scrupulously re-enacted history rarely excites me, even when driven by righteous anger (and it's worth remembering that Z was made while Greece's military dictatorship was very much in power); I recognize this as skillful and impassioned work, but the film's fundamentally journalistic/didactic modus operandi commands polite respect rather than irrepressible ardor. (Rest of the review, along with everything else I write, available via ultra-cheap subscription. Seriously, it’s as little as $1 a month and for now that pays my rent.) ***"
Z,1969,Costa-Gavras, ★★★★★ ," Wow it’s so crazy that the police would collaborate with far right paramilitary groups to assassinate left organizers and political opponents, I’m so glad that doesn’t happen in places like Ferguson, Missouri. The Greek government seems really corrupt back then 😬😬😬 ***"
Z,1969,Costa-Gavras, ★★★★½ ," Un grand film. Parmi les meilleurs thrillers politiques jamais faits.Pour ceux qui ne l'ont jamais vu, la première moitié peut paraître plus difficile à traverser. Mais la deuxième moitié est un véritable feu roulant, et culmine sur deux scènes absolument dévastantes.Ma blonde est justement arrivé dans la pièce au début de la deuxième moitié.

Z,1969,Costa-Gavras, ★★★★ ," Corruption in 60's Greece gets an allegorical treatment in Costa-Gavras' magnificent conspiracy thriller, Z. Its new-wave stylings help craft a dramatic investigation that is also a scathing political takedown. This feels like it was completely made in the edit; real fast cuts and match editing don't give you a minute to breathe, it is relentless in its approach right up until those final moments. ***"

War and Peace,1965,Sergey Bondarchuk, ★★★★½ ," Quite possibly the grandest film ever made. A monumental spectacle that remains unprecedented in its tremendous scope and astonishing execution. This true technical marvel is with great meticulousness and authentic qualities - the perfect composition of two complex and intertwined storylines that vividly depicts humanity and every aspect of it with such inventive techniques to create moods and transition between them. Overall, it's a deeply contemplative, philosophical, poetic, emotional and immensely sublime antiwar portrait - a masterpiece that pushes the boundaries of grandiose filmmaking and never ceases to amaze with its sheer profundity. ***"

So enormous and grand and ballsy and beautiful and measured and reckless. Landing on the moon is cool and all but have you ever tried CINEMA!? ***"
War and Peace,1965,Sergey Bondarchuk, ★★★★★ ," Utterly glorious. Truly must be seen to be believed, and even as it sits before your eyes it seems too good to be true. Sprawls and booms and extends far, far past decent restraints of runtime, but never, miraculously, to its deficit. In Soviet Russia, seven hour films conquer you. ***"

Winner of the 1969 Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film, Bondarchuk’s War and Peace sets the changing fortunes of several aristocratic families against the backdrop of Napoleon’s invasion of Russia. On record as the most expensive Soviet film in history (more than $70 million after inflation), it is also perhaps the greatest epic ever made: an exquisite production of spectacle and realism, the political and personal, that endures as a monumental achievement in filmmaking.

War and Peace,1965,Sergey Bondarchuk, ★★★★½ ," Some of the best war sequences you'll ever see, but it's the battle-less second film depicting the love triangle that really knocked me out. Ludmila Savelyeva and to a slightly lesser extent Sergey Bondarchuk are remarkable. They give the melodrama its depth that keeps you trucking through the slow pace of the narrative. ***"
War and Peace,1965,Sergey Bondarchuk, ★★★★★ , Barry Lyndon for Chads ***
War and Peace,1965,Sergey Bondarchuk, ★★★★★ ," Sergey Bondarchuk’s War and Peace is deliberate before anything else, even before it is grand. Its intentionality manifests everywhere, and is an experience that knows what it owes audiences. It is a massive exploration of the dichotomy after which it is titled, but also all sorts of dichotomies that exist in humanity itself, one of the most interesting being displayed in Natasha’s insistence that a given person lives forever—always existing and always having existed—with Andrei’s dread that on a given day he will entirely “cease to exist.” Virtuous. Lavish. Spectacular. A landmark. ***"
War and Peace,1965,Sergey Bondarchuk, ★★★★½ ," Seven hours of sheer beauty. I have no fluid sentences to describe this film, I only have words:Beautiful, artistic, cinematic, overwhelming, shocking, brutal, classy, unique, fascinating, emotional and unfortunately, too much. It tore me apart and threw me back together, I must’ve cheered and gasped and moved to the edge of my seat in an unspeakable amount of instances.As a technical achievement it’s near perfect, but with its 7 hour runtime not every beat or moment stays so memorable. ***"
War and Peace,1965,Sergey Bondarchuk, ★★★★★ ," Hopefully an actual review coming soon, but if not:The pinnacle of artistic achievement. Bondarchuk so flawlessly blends the grandiose and intimate, seamlessly employing traditional narrative techniques with the kind of experimental techniques found in Malick’s The Tree Of Life (only 50 years prior). I truly never thought Kobayashi’s The Human Condition would be rivaled in its perfection, but Sergey Bondarchuk’s adaptation of the greatest novel ever does so without question. ***"

The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,1948,John Huston, ★★★★★ ," One small step for man, one giant leap for Hollywood. A landmark turning point in the business, Madre was one of the very first to shoot almost entirely on location, resulting in an unheard of 6 months of shooting. The painstaking details have lived long, gracefully aging this story like the finest wine you've tasted. A classic that time has proven will live forever. Walter Huston's performance only turns your ideas of prospecting wild men completely upside down with spellbinding charm. The roots of Daniel Plainview seed their way back to Huston's face in this. ***"

The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,1948,John Huston, ★★★★ ," A nice and tight film that serves as a cautionary tale of greed as three men venture out in Mexico in search of striking gold. Once they do, the effect it has on these men is profound as they struggle with succumbing to greed and the tension is always very high.

Double Indemnity,1944,Billy Wilder, ★★★★½ ," OK, I really don't want to become one of those people who say ""they just don't make them like they used to anymore"", but they truly just don't make them like they used to anymore... ***"
Double Indemnity,1944,Billy Wilder, ★★★★★ ," That brief period where Wilder seemed to be out of fashion among younger critics for being ""a writer first and director second"" sure seems even more ridiculous in immediate retrospect, doesn't it? An excoriating noir not among the underworld but in high-society, where the real amoral money hounds live. Every shot is perfectly framed to make upper-middle-class homes look like desiccated, heavily contested battlegrounds. ***"
Double Indemnity,1944,Billy Wilder, ★★★★★ ," Double Indemnity is the sort of film that reminds me why I love film as much as I do. The script is perfect (apart from small hints of misogyny and racism) with exceptional dialogue. The pacing is taut as there is not a single dull moment. The direction and lighting is next level and the acting is flawless. It can sound tired when people say this but when it comes to Double Indemnity, they really don’t make ‘em like this anymore. Can’t wait to rewatch this new favourite.I wish I could light matches like Neff does.Wilder Ranked List ***"

Raise the Red Lantern,1991,Zhang Yimou, ★★★★★ , Gaslight. Gatekeep. Girlboss. ***
Raise the Red Lantern,1991,Zhang Yimou, ★★★★★ ," Engrossing in ways that most modern films aren’t. Gorgeous to look at, with criticisms on tradition and oppression of women structured so incredibly that it’ll haunt you long after watching it. Gong Li is majestic as the lead, and Zhang Yimou is a master of cinema (pretending The Great Wall doesn’t exist.)That being said, this is in urgent need of a restoration. Criterion, do your thing! ***"
Raise the Red Lantern,1991,Zhang Yimou, ★★★★ ," zhang yimou constructs a symphony of changing relationship dynamics between three women as they all vie for the tiniest pieces of power within a system that imprisons them. and gong li paints it all on her face, she is SO impossibly good. ***"
Raise the Red Lantern,1991,Zhang Yimou, ★★★★★ ," Does the accurate historical date matters? Seventy years later, Yimou's masterpiece of polygamy and competition was banned seemingly with the purpose of overshadowing the chauvinist image of a monstrous regime. Spectacularly shot, the movie gives a clear message, strong to accept yet compatible with the heart, as simple as it may be.96/100 ***"
Raise the Red Lantern,1991,Zhang Yimou, ★★★★★ , gong li really said 'fuck traditions' and we all should get behind her on that! ***

Raise the Red Lantern,1991,Zhang Yimou, ★★★★★ ," Trapped in an intricate labyrinth of empty walls sighs the trepid loneliness of the concubine.An existence marred by the misery of solitude,silenced under the oppression of servitude,the ghosts of the past are now one & the same. ***"
Raise the Red Lantern,1991,Zhang Yimou, ★★★★★ ," Today was the last in-person class of my college career and this is what we watched, so that will always be a wildly weird memory to associate with this but my goodness what a fantastic film. Every part of this is so meticulous and artful, I was on the edge of my seat the whole time, going between awe and shock from moment to moment. ***"
Raise the Red Lantern,1991,Zhang Yimou, ★★★★½ ," songlian invented ""gaslight, gatekeep, girlboss"" ***"
Raise the Red Lantern,1991,Zhang Yimou, ★★★★★ , This had my heart racing. An all-time greatest score and Gong Li's performance might go into my top ten already. The blue snow next to the searing red lanterns will be burned into my memory for a long time. ***
Raise the Red Lantern,1991,Zhang Yimou, ★★★★ , An agonizing parade of suffering. Destructive traditions. The Patriarchy. The Wealthy. Burn them all down and shit on the ashes. ***
Raise the Red Lantern,1991,Zhang Yimou, ★★★★½ , A quietly powerful and tragic look at the horrors of deep-rooted female oppression and how it perpetuates in a culture over time. Autonomy is taken away and the women fight amongst themselves for what little they can but they’re all subservient to the faceless man who controls them. Loved the gorgeous yet claustrophobic compositions and the excellent score. ***
Raise the Red Lantern,1991,Zhang Yimou, ★★★★★ ," Gosh, this film is just absolutely brilliant. Watching it twice so close together only heightened my appreciation for it. The way this film evokes claustrophobia through colors, silence, having a wall visible in just about every (if not every) scene is so subtle but effective. The acting Gong Li could do with just her face is devastatingly incredible. This is one of the best movies I have watched in a long while, and my love for it only grows the more I sit with it. ***"
Raise the Red Lantern,1991,Zhang Yimou, ★★★★½ ," Feels very existential which I quite liked. No matter what our protagonist does, the outcome is the same. Also the production design, sheesh. Very glad I checked this one out (literally, cause I got it from the library)! ***"
Raise the Red Lantern,1991,Zhang Yimou, ★★★★½ ," 9/10A feminist tale about how the patriarchy brainwashes women into attacking each other. It starts off slow, but once the drama gets going, it gets going. ***"
Raise the Red Lantern,1991,Zhang Yimou, ★★★★★ ," ""Raise the Red Lantern"" RAISED A GREAT BIG FUCKING SMILE ON MY FUCKING FACE.What a film. There are no words. ***"
Raise the Red Lantern,1991,Zhang Yimou, ★★★★½ ," jealousy, despair, loneliness, depression, manipulation...Slow burning gorgeous looking entry into the topic of back stabbing bitches ... how these women are reduced into nothing but maids and mistresses is pretty fucking sad. I do think The Favourite does this better but both are great. ***"
Raise the Red Lantern,1991,Zhang Yimou, ★★★★½ , Palme d'Or winners. There is more intrigue amongst these women then the entire 007 franchise put together. ***

The Lives of Others,2006,Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, ★★★★★ ," Hi everybody, today I wanna introduce you to one of my absolutely favorite movies. This German Film shows the cruelty’s of GDR regime in the mid and late 80s. No movie before showed this theme such intense and well played like this Film. The great Ulrich Mühe does his bist career performance and one of the best I have ever seen. All the other actors are memorable as well. Great art direction and a tremendous score together with a good directing work, makes this movie to an absolutely masterpiece of German and international cinema. ***"
The Lives of Others,2006,Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, ★★★★★ ," La importancia de ser autor. Sin importar cómo. Bajo el contexto que sea. Con el riesgo que ello implique. Y con las armas que se dispongan, que probablemente no sean las que uno pueda elegir. En el medio, conviven Rear Window, The Conversation, De Palma, y el cine de detectives y espionaje ya tan perdido. Todo esto, con la emotividad propia de un melodrama. ***"

The Lives of Others,2006,Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, ★★★★ , Pure and prime example of men need therapy cinema ***
The Lives of Others,2006,Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, ★★★★★ , Okay I think this has gotta be up there as one of my favorite movies. 4.5 stars last time but it gets the full 5 now. One full star just for the ending alone. A 30 minute epilogue with multiple “# years later” done really well. East Germans do be snitching!!!!!!!!!! ***
The Lives of Others,2006,Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, ★★★★★ ," ""To think that people like you ruled a country""This is a stunning debut in which the director creates an atmosphere which made me think that this really was 1984!!! It has excellent performances aided by some beautiful western classical music at the right moments; in certain aspects it reminded me of Harry Caul.This winner of the Best Foreign Film at the Academy Awards is a powerful look at lives crumbling and resurrected under a strict regime. ***"
The Lives of Others,2006,Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, ★★★★★ ," Perfectly cast, perfectly paced, perfectly set, perfectly intense, perfectly shot, perfect ending. In a nutshell, this is a perfect film. ***"
The Lives of Others,2006,Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, ★★★★★ ," An all-time favourite of mine and one which never fails to move me and leave me emotionally shaken. Surprising really that a film whose primary colour palette consists mainly of greys and browns can elicit such a colourful reaction but the story, the setting, the characters and the superb performances all contribute towards making this a truly poignant and unforgettable experience. Made even more so by the very sad loss soon after it's release of the lead actor, Ulrich Muhe.Highly recommended. ***"
The Lives of Others,2006,Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, ★★★★½ ," Mercy Without PraiseA lesson in history and humanity that is a touch sentimental at times nor entirely convincing that a Stasi agent in his 40's should suddenly develop a spontaneous empathy. Still, that's the strange world of non-fiction for you.Conservatively written and assuredly made its a very safe and accessible film never putting a foot wrong and pacing well between its account and its pauses for poignance. An insightful performance by Ulrich Muhe as a the meek doppelgänger of Kevin Spacey. ***"
The Lives of Others,2006,Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, ★★★★½ ," A quietly thrilling and constantly engaging film.Ulrich Mühe's performance is one of the most underrated of all time in my opinion. It's so subtle, yet it conveys so much about the emotional journey his character goes through. ***"
The Lives of Others,2006,Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, ★★★★★ ," To HGW XX/7, in gratitude.I didn't actually expect a political thriller to elicit such intense emotions from me. In the end, I was taken aback. This is the essence of humanity. ***"

The Lives of Others,2006,Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, ★★★★★ ," Tenía esta película en mi lista desde hace mucho y ahora me cuestiono por qué la postergué tanto.Un thriller político y humano que se desliza con sumo control y elegancia durante su extenso metraje sin que éste haga caer al espectador en el tedio en ningún momento.El guión es magnífico, demostrando que incluso en medio de la persecución ideológica y la guerra, la empatía continúa existiendo y la clemencia es posible. Un relato de valentía, de rebeldía, de búsquedas y de significados profundos. Un relato por el que vale la pena dejarse sacudir y conmover. ***"
The Lives of Others,2006,Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, ★★★★½ ," Lives of Others shows one's self inner conflict of commitment and human consciousness. As the chapters unfold, our protagonist starts questioning what his life has been about. He starts rediscovering his morality and whether being a human at all costs is the right thing to do. Filmmaking at its finest with a conclusion that lingers with you for a long time after the credits roll. Feeling a solid 9 ***"
The Lives of Others,2006,Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, ★ ," This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  incredible how this film is boring, sexist, AND anti-communist at the same time. drenched in the painfully liberal german disdain for the GDR [will be part of an essay on anti-communism in german film in the future]. anyways, great example of german oscarbait!  ***"
The Lives of Others,2006,Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, ★★★★ ," That guy looked like Kevin Spacey and had a voice similar to Stanley Tucci. I COULDN'T HELP IT😂Brilliant film, smart writing and an acting masterclass if you ask me. Kinda loved it. ***"

There is only IBM, and ITT, and AT&T, and DuPont, Dow, Union Carbide, and Exxon.""This film is 40 years old, and the above quote rings just as true today as it did back then.

Network,1976,Sidney Lumet, ★★★★★ ," A raging, haywire and socially anarchic satire that is executed with mythic intensity and entertains as a gorgeous mess. Lumet interprets and masters the vivid idea of when discombobulation and anger meet, that being the state of mind that almost all human beings face, visually and narratively ensuring that it’ll get more intense and prominent with time. Through this, the audience is given a force of calculated instability that runs within the workplace and sees the backstories and personalities of each ingredient. There’s such a damaging, critiquing effect over each moment yet the chaos is what makes it so entertaining. ***"

Network,1976,Sidney Lumet, ★★★ ," Loved Peter Finch’s acting in this, his scenes made the movie, especially the I’m mad as hell scene is one I won’t forget. What an acting. Everything in between was kinda boring, the message is clear that its all about views, but that’s nothing new. Although its crazy how relevant it still is today. I wished it kinda focused more on Finch’s speeches and the impact of that since that were the highlights for sure. ***"

Metropolis,1927,Fritz Lang, ★★★★½ ," Metropolis is a cinematic masterpiece. It has so many layers to it. There is so much depth in the story and characters. It’s a complete breakdown on society’s structure of leaders, the working class, technology, and religion. The effects in this movie are stunning even nearly 100 years later. ***"
Metropolis,1927,Fritz Lang, ★★★★★ ," A visually stunning science fiction romp through still relative ideology, Metropolis is incredibly ambitious, with towering sets that astound and some damn fine displays of German expressionism. The remastered score on the Kino Lorber Blu-ray is TO DIE FOR. ***"

Raging Bull,1980,Martin Scorsese, ★★★★ ," how i imagine every conversation went between martin scorsese and robert de niro when it was time to make their new movie, circa 1973-1995marty: hey bobrobert: heymarty: so, how would you like to play the worst man of all time? just like, the worst man to ever exist?robert *tearing up*: oh man, you just get me as a creator and an actor, don't you?(i really liked this, btw.) ***"

Raging Bull,1980,Martin Scorsese, ★★★★½ ," Every aspect of this movie is great.Writing, directing, acting, editing, cinematography, etc.It's all fucking fantastic. One of the Scorsese's best films...If not his best! Truly phenomenal stuff.Maybe even the finest performance of DeNiro's illustrious career.I honestly can't believe I waited this long to see it. Grave mistake.This. After Hours. Taxi Driver. Three of the best films of '75 - '85.PS: the ending of Boogie Nights, another film that I love, is, in my opinion, an obvious homage to the ending of this film... though I'm sure that the comparison has been made many times before. ***"

Raging Bull,1980,Martin Scorsese, ★★★★★ , While many claim this is Martin Scorsese best film I must respectfully disagree! I see it more as the primordial ooze from which all of Scorsese's films draw their first breath! His artistic seminal gene pool if you will!A difficult film to rank as it deals with a very flawed real life character whom has no redeeming qualities! The strengths of the film revolve around the brutally realistic fight scenes! And what I consider to be Robert De Niro's role of a lifetime! All of which pales in comparison to Scorsese's directorial expertise!You are in luck! It is currently streaming on NF! ***
Raging Bull,1980,Martin Scorsese, ★★★★½ ," Rewatched RAGING BULL. Remembered virtually every scene despite not having seen it in 7-8 years. Such unforgettable performances and revolutionary editing. Martin Scorsese's ultimate technical masterpiece, one the greatest American films ever made. My favorite thing about the movie is how the boxing sequences are shot, they are brutally realistic, you feel the impact of every punch. ***"

Das Boot,1981,Wolfgang Petersen, ★★★★★ , Very rarely do we see movies which has an ending which was totally unexpected!.Normally we see the Allies suffering the losses caused by their conquerors;but here it heightens the tragedy after the heroes have returned from a successful mission. The camerawork is the highlight here;the cramped spaces resemble a labor camp in which all the residents have to adjust to the less space given to them.This film has some of the best action set pieces i have seen in cinema.A sense of claustrophobia permeates throughout the majority of the film.One of the greatest war movies ever.Period. ***
Das Boot,1981,Wolfgang Petersen, ★★★★½ ," Relentless and unparalleled classic submarine tale of WWII, told from the perspective of the Germans who fought for Hitler in the Atlantic Ocean. Best sub movie ever. Still one of the top modern war movies out there.88/100 ***"

Das Boot,1981,Wolfgang Petersen, ★★★★½ ," A few things I've come to realize over the years....1. Larger budgets, big name actors, and the Hollywood machine don't always equate to better films (""Necessity is the Mother of Invention""), and Das Boot is the classic example of this. Has Wolfgang Petersen come close to making another film this good?2. I prefer the Theatrical cut to the Director's cut. I enjoyed the jumbo 3+ hour version as a novelty, but when it comes to a rewatch I always pick the shorter version. Also true of Apocalypse Now. ***"
Das Boot,1981,Wolfgang Petersen, ★★★★½ ," iMDB Top 250 #222That runtime scared me. 3.5 hours? This was gonna be a challenge. Turns out the length never really becomes a factor when you are so immersed in the story, characters and direction of a fantastic movie. The claustrophobic feel makes you become invested in all the men on the submarine, and you feel their fear when they do. The final hour is 5 stars in itself, and the final 10 minutes is 6 stars.My final movie in the iMDB top 100, and I can see why its there. ***"
Das Boot,1981,Wolfgang Petersen, ★★★ , wild ***
Das Boot,1981,Wolfgang Petersen, ★★★½ ," Watched the director’s cut which is 3.5 hours long. Didn’t feel much tension, felt nothing for the characters, and was barely interested in the story, BUT the GORGEOUS lighting and set are what kept my attention. If anything, watch for that. It wasn’t as immersive as I’d hoped it’d be, I found myself dozing off a couple times, but I thought the ending was great. I hope I get the chance to see it in a theater one day, I have a feeling I’d feel differently about it then. ***"
Das Boot,1981,Wolfgang Petersen, ★★★½ ," I cannot believe i am saying this, but i actually wish i saw the extended version that is 80 minutes longer than the already 210 minute directors cut. ***"

Das Boot,1981,Wolfgang Petersen, ★★★★ ," Das Boot ist ein Klassiker des deutschen Kinos. Sei es das großartige Ensemble, die bedrückende Spannung oder der berühmte Score. Das Boot ist eine echte Sternstunde, leidet im Directors Cut dann aber doch an wenigen, wirklich seltenen Stellen an der Überlänge. Jedenfalls war das deutsche Kino 1981 dank Wolfgang Petersen und seiner Crew kurzzeitig mal ein Licht in Hollywood und wurde zu Recht 6x für den Oscar nominiert. ***"
Das Boot,1981,Wolfgang Petersen, ★★★★★ ," One of the best war films! Bold, Ferocious, Nail-Bitting, Intriguing. Every second of 209 minutes film is subtly crafted, meticulously composed, detailing that captures the real war experience. It focuses on the soldier on a very human level and tells us a genuine breathtaking story. The nerve-wracking tension, psychological pressure, fear, survival, dullness & excitement of war are so palpable, you cannot but feel it. The greeny, shaky, and close-up add an extra layer to the film. Plus, careful and accurate production design helps to build the atmosphere of this masterclass movie. Overall, ""Das Boot"" is definitely one of the greatest war movies ever made. ***"
Das Boot,1981,Wolfgang Petersen, ★★★★★ , Incredible. Director’s Cut.Incredible.More fruit in film. In a film shot in close quarters you can share the frame with a pineapple. The captain’s eyes demand the whole frame to themselves. So many hints of crazy. You can be yourself under the surface. Where it’s dark. ***
Das Boot,1981,Wolfgang Petersen, ★★★★ , Epic in every sense. The sounds and darkness just make it so tense and claustrophobic. And that ending. Jeez.8/10 ***
Das Boot,1981,Wolfgang Petersen, ★★★★★ ," It's quite incredible when a film is able to sustain all of the tension and suspense in a 3.5 hour runtime. ""The Boat"" succeeds both as a action filled blockbuster and as a human drama thanks to it's dedicated cast and a intelligent script. A classic in the war genre, no doubt about it. ***"

Throne of Blood,1957,Akira Kurosawa, ★★★★½ , Pretty good movie. Would have been perfect if there was an actual throne made of blood though. ***
Throne of Blood,1957,Akira Kurosawa, ★★★★ ," Kurosawa’s exceptional craftsmanship and cinematic style elevates the dramatics to a high tier, keeping you engaged all through. Cinematography definitely needs a special mention. Toshiro Mifune's death scene at the end was remarkably executed. The iconic scene will be remembered for many more ages to come. One of the best adaptation of Macbeth out there. Do give it a shot. ***"
Throne of Blood,1957,Akira Kurosawa, ★★★★½ , Shakespeare must have been QUAKING when this released. Not even he could’ve written a better ending. ***

Throne of Blood,1957,Akira Kurosawa, ★★★★ , Far out that final scene is destined to become one of my favourite Kurosawa moments ever. Like I think when I finish his filmography it'll be guaranteed top ten scenes.Kurosawa brings his striking visuals and Toshiro Mifune brings his usual excellence and hot bod.Awesome movie.Kurosawa Ranked List ***
Throne of Blood,1957,Akira Kurosawa, ★★★★ ," if ye had the chance to change yer fate, would ye? ***"
Throne of Blood,1957,Akira Kurosawa, ★★★★ ," At its best as a near abstract dive into ambition mud. Sometimes dramatic flat as if Kurosawa is trying too hard to import Shakespeare to give weight to perfectly fine genre material, but dude could conjure an image with the best of them and as a doom laced collection of ambition gone awry imagery this has few peers and his sense of spectacle is as always first rate. Also, Mifune, one of the great overactors, has rarely find a more suited role for his bigger than the frame persona. ***"
Throne of Blood,1957,Akira Kurosawa, ★★★★★ ," As controversial a statement this may be, I am really not a fan of Shakespeare, but Kurosawa always packages it in a way that works for me; Ran (based on King Lear) and The Bad Sleep Well (a very loose adaptation of Hamlet) are also fantastic takes on The Bard’s work but Throne of Blood stands out just ahead of the others thanks to its incredibly immersive atmosphere and a career highlight of a performance from Mifune.Slightly longer version of my thoughts on this masterpiece up here if you fancy a look ***"

Throne of Blood,1957,Akira Kurosawa, ★★★★ , Arrows and edge wipes.The final image of the woods in the fog coming to life.Mifune.Kurosawa is like no other. ***
Throne of Blood,1957,Akira Kurosawa, ★★★★½ ," When you play the game of thrones you win, or you die. Arrows as shadows in a grim castle covered in fog, Toshiro Mifune amplifying his Rashomon-tier madness -- as if it's possible! -- as a whirlwind of consequences shakes a fortress at its very foundation. Tragedy looms, guilt sticks like unfading blood stains.Full of scorpions is my mind..Kurosawa adapts Shakespeare with unparalleled energy, this time it's a tale of survival. Geometric beauty and sweeping landscapes are both frequent guests by now, Kurosawa's haunting screen composition never ceases to amaze. ***"
Throne of Blood,1957,Akira Kurosawa, ★★★★★ ," Proof of the fungibility of Shakespeare’s genius is that even with his poetry stripped away, his characters and themes can be transposed into an experimental mix of Japanese Noh Theater and samurai adventure with the result being maybe the greatest Shakespeare film of all time. (I consider it second after Chimes at Midnight.) Or perhaps it’s simply proof of Kurosawa’s genius. ***"
Throne of Blood,1957,Akira Kurosawa, ★★★½ ," I think this is Kurosawas first film to disappoint me. Don’t get me wrong it’s still a very good movie, especially for its time, but it didn’t amaze me like Kurosawa's other films. He didn’t really use the black and white color gradation as masterfully as he does in his other movies, and the story seemed a bit convoluted. ***"

Unaware of that cage, he struggles against it until he meets his inevitable end. ***"
Le Samouraï,1967,Jean-Pierre Melville, ★★★★ ," Slick and methodical. I love how no detail is too insignificant to edit over- it all adds to the gently boiling tension. Alain Delon is obviously phenomenal, one of the best examples of a character so inscrutable that we'd rather just watch him than actually know more about him.The bird in a cage symbolism is intriguing, especially since Jef never loses his cool. ***"

Solaris,1972,Andrei Tarkovsky, None ," Oh Tarkovsky, why do your films trouble me so? I was left awe-struck, knocked out, and supremely moved by Solaris, but I was also left scratching my head at many points. There's A LOT to unpack here, and while I cannot justly rate it until I sit down and re-watch, I found it to be a languid and mesmerizing journey. ***"
Solaris,1972,Andrei Tarkovsky, ★★★★ ," A dreamlike journey into space, into Kelvin's mind, into the fictional planet Solaris.A film about letting go, brimming with emotions. A thank you letter, or rather, a challenge, to Stanley Kubrick's 2001.A meticulous study on character developmentAn ambitious film. Slow, but marvelous. A film with an unusually long run-time, but every frame is treated with care.A frustrating ending that can either be interpreted metaphorically or literally.Another thought-provoking masterwork by Andrei Tarkovsky. ***"
Solaris,1972,Andrei Tarkovsky, ★★★★★ ," Tarkovsky considered “Solaris” his own least favorite work because it was too much of a genre film; a classification he always sought to elude. While “Solaris” does not entirely escape some of the tropes of science fiction, Tarkovsky only proves his own thesis in its making. Whether man travels to space, to the Zone, or even just across the span of his own time, he lugs his own faulty desires with him. And, just as depicted with trademark Tarkovsky hypnotic mastery in “Solaris,” this is both selfish, and the most deeply human of acts - worthy in its failure of all the love the universe can muster. ***"

Aftersun,2022,Charlotte Wells, ★★★★★ ," To articulate any of my thoughts with eloquence feels impossible, mostly because melancholy has consumed me. This is weapons-grade sadness.It’s easy to dismiss what life was like for our parents. So many of them were so young when their lives stopped being their own, but what’s even stranger was how normalized it was. Of course some voluntarily chose that path, but I think Aftersun reminds us that regret and despondency doesn’t wilt away simply because we’ve created life. We can love and still feel broken. ***"

The Celebration,1998,Thomas Vinterberg, ★★★★½ ," Creative, intelligent, and entirely fucked up. This is genius. Vinterberg completely nails each nuance of the dialogue with the comedic aspects as well as in constructing suspense. It’s also easy to see why the Dogme 95 movement is so highly regarded, and this is it at its best. Balancing comedy and tragedy is always going to be a challenge for any filmmaker yet Vinterberg manages seamlessly. ***"

It's so impressive how even striped of all cinematic conventions a moment like that can still feel so powerful.

Rocco and His Brothers,1960,Luchino Visconti, ★★★★½ ," Luchino Visconti’s epic melodrama of social migration and moral decay was first released in 1960, when it was met with great scandal (a prosecutor threatened to charge the director with “disseminating an obscene object”) and even greater success. Today, distanced from ridiculous controversy and dislocated from the provincial politics that drive its story, this immaculately restored classic of post-WWII Italian cinema often feels like a new experience altogether.

Rocco and His Brothers,1960,Luchino Visconti, ★★★★ ," ”My whole family arrived unexpectedly like an earthquake…”A sprawling melodrama that’s the story of five brothers from a poor Italian family all trying to find their way, and the mother who desperately wants everything to be alright.This is an incredibly thick movie, and there’s so much to take in, including a fantastic theatrical conclusion, that I feel I need to see it again in order to have any hope of beginning to unpack it. ”I was happy as a child.The trouble started later on.”Cinematic Time Capsule - 1960 RankedMartin Scorsese’s Favorite FilmsRoger Ebert’s The Great Movies Volume III ***"
Rocco and His Brothers,1960,Luchino Visconti, ★★★★★ ," The varied personalities of the brothers are no coincidence since Visconti's episodic structure has the specific purpose of displaying those social strata that form part of everyday's conflicts under the smart pretext of ""we are all brothers; our society is a massive family"". Its roots can be appreciated in the new wave of American directors of the 70s, most predominantly Scorsese, yet this powerful epic has not quite been surpassed in both its intentions and its honest, tragic nature. A powerful statement even for today's standards.98/100P.S. Hunt down the three-hour version. There is a reason for that. ***"

Rocco and His Brothers,1960,Luchino Visconti, ★★★★½ , This is such an immersive experience. Over the course of the ambitious runtime you really come to know and relate to each one of the respective brothers and their struggles. You can really empathise with each knew situation they are placed in. Except Simone who can fuck off forever. ***

Vertigo,1958,Alfred Hitchcock, ★★★★★ ," 100/100A ghost story with no future, with the past lingering like green neon. Any beauty or hope is conveyed through surfaces and costumes, a look for desire and obsession fulfilled. If the crashing waves and towering trees greet our doomed lovers, then the bustling streets of modern culture - a world on the cusp of change - will reject it all until it's a mirage; haze evoked though aching memory and spectral shadows. The Greatest Film of All Time? You won't see me disagreeing. ***"

Ugetsu,1953,Kenji Mizoguchi, ★★★★★ ," feels like there's no one more misandrist filmmaker than mizoguchi, all the men in his films that i've seen are such pathetic bastards, consumed by their own cowardice and idiocy, meanwhile the woman bear all the consequences of those sins AND the responsibility of forgiving them. of course there's an immense melancholy at the end of ugetsu, but it's only obtained after an immense series of follies and mishaps... perhaps mizoguchi is being optimistic here, though. there can be learning through suffering, if we're open to hearing the lessons we need to hear. ***"

Ugetsu,1953,Kenji Mizoguchi, ★★★★★ ," Ugetsu adapts its narrative from Ueda Akinari's stories The House in the Thicket and The Lust of the White Serpent and blossoms into an evocative and extraordinary tale of obsession and misconception. It contains some bewitching cinematography by Kazuo Miyagawa and is frequently considered a masterwork of Japanese cinema. It excellently toches on such themes as the misery of circumstances, the potential for redemption, the enrichment of the human spirit through artistry and the chaos of conflict. It's an outstanding feature film from Kenji Mizoguch and a stunning example of Japan's Golden Age. ***"

Ugetsu,1953,Kenji Mizoguchi, ★★★★ ," Deeply unsettling and tragic fable with a perfect score and a very mysterious atmosphere. Ugetsu brilliantly juggles greed, obsession, lust, violence, war, masculinity, imperialism, and more in under 100 minutes to form a cohesive morality tale. Not entirely sure why horror isn't at least one of the genre tags here on Letterboxd, because the climactic scene was pretty damn horrifying. 2021 Criterion Challenge (Round 2) - 25/52 (#25 - Martin Scorcese's Top 10) ***"
Ugetsu,1953,Kenji Mizoguchi, ★★★ ," This film is shot very beautifully. Unfortunately that’s the only thing I like about it.The performances are much too over the top for me to engage with this. None of these characters feel real.Also, women being raped and murdered for the sake of a plot that’s not even about them is really yucky to me. And if this is supposed to be a cautionary tale about delusions of grandeur than the men with the delusions who were irresponsible should have been the ones to suffer in the end, not their wives. Secondhand punishment isn’t terribly effective, at least not as a narrative device. ***"

Rashomon,1950,Akira Kurosawa, ★★★★★ , im convinced akira kurosawa saw this world in a way no one else had; for what it bittersweetly is to what it hopefully can be. Rashomon made me believe in magic: how this weaves between being a genuine mystery and asking the audience to demystify a situation to focus on how honest we are within ourselves is a stroke of a filmmaker that's supernaturally gifted. they really dont make em like they used to. ***

Rashomon,1950,Akira Kurosawa, ★★★★★ ," truth is cheap; choice is hard. i don't think there's a single camera movement or edit here that isn't extremely meaningful and emotional. kurosawa exercises total authority over the viewer without it ever feeling overwrought, especially during the medium's story... hard to think of a better way to tell a tale about subjectivity than bringing the full-force of the supernatural to bear, implicating the heavens and earth in a united fallen morality. ***"
Rashomon,1950,Akira Kurosawa, ★★★½ ," A lot has been written on Rashomon, but not enough about how Kurosawa’s control of mood and the near horror atmosphere serve as an anchor to the film narrative playground. ***"
Rashomon,1950,Akira Kurosawa, ★★★★ ," This classic will always be remembered for its inventive narrative techniques, which went onto inspire numerous future movies. It neatly explores the humanity, psychological human nature and the varied subjective perspectives of truth through its cleverly layered narrative and solid allegories. The climax sums up the profound thesis in an interestingly beautiful manner. Definitely recommended. ***"

Watching this in 1950 must have been incredible. It's short, it's snappy and it's full to the brim of excitement. Nowadays, these type of films with the whole investigating the characters and trying to figure out who did what has been done thousands of times but this is easily up there as one of the best. ***"

Rashomon,1950,Akira Kurosawa, ★★★½ ," Aside from being ensnared in countless moments of yelling and overacting, in Rashomon, Akira Kurosawa deftly presents ""the truth"" in the shape of light streaking through the leaves of the trees, obfuscating what was essentially known as humanity’s last hope and goodness in the tenebrous depths of illusion. Truth is subjective. The truth is relative that even the dead may lie. Great film (if it hasn't been said already) ***"

A Special Day,1977,Ettore Scola, ★★★★ ," i NEED to see this in the theater and be inside this soundscape....like...oh my god...ettore scola is doing SO much with that radio broadcast and the bird sounds to create this oppressive yet empty atmosphere, it's incredible. also apparently this is my first sophia loren film??? that's so fucked up of me?? what an oversight??? regardless she and marcello are both SO good, perhaps my favorite of marcello's dramatic performances. ugh anyway what a stunning chamber piece, i cannot wait to return to this. ***"

A Special Day,1977,Ettore Scola, ★★★★ ," A shoulder shared is weight lifted. Despite the different lives we lead and the incompatible views we carry, loneliness, strangely enough, brought us closer. Surrounded by so many, yet so alone. Perhaps it's mere chance or maybe the path was craved long ago, all I can say with certainty is that you saved me, this fateful, dark day. Maybe a day is all our friendship will get in this life, but maybe that's all it needed. ***"

A Special Day,1977,Ettore Scola, ★★★★ ," Quite remarkable how such a simple film can cover so many themes/human emotions. A chance encounter between a tired housewife and unemployed former radio-announcer. Prolonged conversations. Two opposing political ideologies. A historic meeting between Hitler and Mussolini at the forefront of a fascist parade going on outside. Two incredible actors: Loren and Mastroianni. All you need to direct a beautiful story.  (For some reason Amazon prime only has the English dubbed version, which was annoying but I got over it. I think the original Italian version would be even better) ***"
A Special Day,1977,Ettore Scola, ★★★★½ ," a deceptively simple humanist drama that threatens to crumble under the weight of sadness and tragedy that it carries. Marcello Mastroianni absolutely soars, giving his finest performance, and Sophia Loren matches him moment for moment. a truly transcendent, and tragic, work of film. one I'll be thinking about for years to come. ***"
A Special Day,1977,Ettore Scola, ★★★★★ ," There's so much to talk about with this film, but one thing that really touched me is the way this film took the Third Reich Anthem, a song that the characters could constantly hear blaring through their windows, interrupting and invading their love and lives, and changing the evil and hate-filled connotations the anthem once held, into a beautiful, heartwrenching love song for their intimate relationship (can you even call it romance? The way they kiss and embrace each other feels like so so so much more than just a romance that it's hard to describe in words). Truly powerful stuff. ***"
A Special Day,1977,Ettore Scola, ★★★★ , Great Italian drama here with two masterful performances of the probably greatest actress Italias loren and greatest actor Italias mastroianni who more and more comes into my light because he’s a really great actor. The story behind is very cool especially the introduction from old real pictures of hitlers italia arrive and then to the story itself which takes place in the foreground of the parade. Interesting themes especially when it all highlights in a fine ending. ***
Ace in the Hole,1951,Billy Wilder, ★★★★½ , not the silly goose time i thought it’d be ***
Ace in the Hole,1951,Billy Wilder, ★★★★½ ," 87/100The equivalent of a deranged maniac rubbing salt into a wound while a rabid dog lunges at your feet. Twisted, dark, feverishly cynical, and hungrily steamy from the first filthy frame to the last ironic mic drop; Billy Wilder's Ace in the Hole crafts a chaotic atmosphere while simultaneously building human relationships and wrapping an organic message around its snappy screenplay. Everything just flies off the screen in a way that only Billy Wilder can orchestrate. Kirk Douglas is life. ***"
Ace in the Hole,1951,Billy Wilder, ★★★★½ , the way things change.... the way they stay the same. billy wilder held up a twisted mirror to his own time and created classics for the ages. human nature was rotten then and it’s rotten now. watch those black hearts drip. ***

I love you... xxx ***"
Ace in the Hole,1951,Billy Wilder, ★★★★ ," The year is 1951 and Kirk Douglas delivers one of his very best performances. This is uncanny...✔️ Manipulation of the public by the press✔️ Changing the narrative to fit the desired political outcome✔️ A steady stream of lies and misdirection✔️ An actual media circus, complete with big wheel and merry go roundSounds just like the 2020 worldwide Covid press circus to me. ***"
Ace in the Hole,1951,Billy Wilder, ★★★★½ ," If a crooked smile were ever to be a film, it would probably be this one. As cynical as they come Ace in the Hole is a scathing critique of the media and capitalism as a whole. Wilder absolutely does it again. Another masterpiece by him and one where you are lucky to escape with your faith in humanity. ***"
Ace in the Hole,1951,Billy Wilder, ★★★★½ , So this is basically J. Jonah Jameson in the 50s? ***
Ace in the Hole,1951,Billy Wilder, ★★★★★ ," Billy Wilder's grim, bleak, cynical, and just-about-perfect drama has fallen-from-grace newspaperman Kirk Douglas trying to worm his way back to the top of his profession by manipulating a situation where a small-town treasure-hunter is trapped in a cave. His willingness to exploit a man's suffering for his own benefit is fascinating, especially since he doesn't seem to be evil so much as selfish—but the film's real strength is in watching him break down as the situation evolves radically over time. A longtime favorite, highly recommended—and an upcoming Dissolve movie of the week. ***"

Ace in the Hole,1951,Billy Wilder, ★★★★ ," The Criterion Challenge 2022The greed of media and the exploitation of tragedy, Ace In The Hole marks another cynically acerbic censure of American culture from Billy Wilder. Following arguably his most revered work which also criticised the ruthless desire for sensation, Sunset Boulevard, Wilder moves away from the destructive force that is Hollywood and ventures into journalistic corruption, set in pallid Albuquerque. Kirk Douglas' performance as Chuck Tatum is fantastic, bringing to life a character who breathes an aggressive and toxic ambition. Wilder's direction, as always, is top notch, but it is his screenplay, again as always, that shines the brightest. ***"
Ace in the Hole,1951,Billy Wilder, ★★★★½ ," Crítica al consumo y producción de periodismo amarillo, al chantaje por parte del poder mediático, la corrupción y la avaricia descontrolada, todo esto lleva al protagonista a un nivel inmoral de gigantescas proporciones. ***"
Ace in the Hole,1951,Billy Wilder, ★★★★½ ," ""Bad news sells best. Good news is no news.""Journalists, amirite? Carried entirely by an absolutely massive Kirk Douglas performance, furiously single-minded in his search for the Big Story, a slimy dickhead who only gains self-awareness after it's way too late.Wilder really made a movie in 1951 that taps into my current feelings on the bottomless 24/7 news cycle, doomscrolling Twitter reading awful story after awful story, people exploiting recent tragedies to push hashtags and hawk merch, etc. My favorite Wilder so far, by a wide margin. ***"

Ace in the Hole,1951,Billy Wilder, ★★★★½ ," Probably the Billy Wilder movie that best fits the overused ""cynical"" descriptor. Less satisfying than his best stuff, probably because he's less concerned with exploring his characters than he is in presenting a relatively straightforward parable, but this is still pleasingly nasty and as well-crafted and acted as you would expect. Wilder never gets any credit as a visual stylist but check out the way he handles the increasingly appalling vulgarity of the situation - not to mention that downright inhuman final shot. ***"

La Notte,1961,Michelangelo Antonioni, ★★★★ ," Regarded as the middle movie of a trilogy which begun with L'Avventura and ended with L'Eclisse, La Notte relates to the demise of warmth and passion between prosperous novelist, Giovanni Pontano (Marcello Mastroianni) and his discontented wife, Lidia (Jeanne Moreau). This time Michelangelo Antonioni compresses the frame with some meticulously constructed compositions and characters who are barely competent in managing to exist together harmoniously. It perhaps leans too heavily into some oblique details at times, but its central theme of isolationism is always emotionally engaging. ***"

La Notte,1961,Michelangelo Antonioni, ★★★★★ ," my current favorite of antonioni's alienation trilogy, his most relaxed and haunted work, a single day and night flattened by the speculative eventuality of 'events' which never actually occur; there are only dioramas of life lived in emergent geometric and spatial relations. an anti-dialectical film at its purest, art achieved without heavy-handed melodrama or speculative compression, the bareness of reality, unflinching, remarkable, kinetics of symbol, the freedom of the interval; a bunch of hot people who cannot escape from being themselves. ***"
La Notte,1961,Michelangelo Antonioni, ★★★½ ," 70/100A.V. Club review. First half (through the nightclub) is arguably the modernist masterpiece, though now I'm curious to see how I'll respond to L'Avventura when I revisit it. (First and only viewing was 13 years ago; I'm not sure what stage of metamorphosis my taste had reached at that point.) Less enamored of the hour-long party setpiece, which makes concrete what had previously been ineffable (and largely architectural). But even that has its Vitti—sorry, I mean its moments. ***"

Nostalgia,1983,Andrei Tarkovsky, ★★★★½ ," 9/10My second watch.Maybe the Tarkovsky I understand the most and also maybe the easiest to watch. That's not to say that his other films are too complicated for me to enjoy, nor that this one isn't challenging and thought-provoking, but for some reason Nostalgia is the one that comes together in a way that makes perfect sense to me. I feel like I can trace my investment in arthouse as a cinematic form to the moment I first witnessed the final twenty perfect minutes of this movie. Indescribably moving. Not quite a 10 (yet?), but very nearly there. ***"
Nostalgia,1983,Andrei Tarkovsky, ★★★½ ," Yes I watched a Tarkovsky film every day this week. I saw this a very long time ago, on a rented VHS of all things, and it didn't really hold up for me despite some great shots. You could say I didn't have any nostalgia for it... ***"
Nostalgia,1983,Andrei Tarkovsky, ★★★★★ ," One drop plus one drop makes a bigger drop, not two.Tarkovsky is amazing. Like his other films, Nostalgia is rather puzzle-like, but the pieces are all right there in front of you. I'm not going to attempt to explain the feelings I derived from this film, as ""Poetry is untranslatable, like the whole of art."" I'll just say that Tarkovsky is a master of cinema, and this is a must-watch for anyone who enjoys studying film. The cinematography alone is breathtaking. ***"
Eureka,2000,Shinji Aoyama, ★★★★★ ," Fascinating — I love film. These ‘not so subtle’ reminders as to why I love film so much , are very much apparent in this behemoth of a film.

But it’s sure as hell one mighty feeling of a film.Truly at a loss for words , it’s a masterpiece & I say that with my chest.How can any artist show how trauma affects us over time? Constant trauma & yet remind us that intimate connection is possible….Well, It’s done proudly here. Revisiting soon I hope… ***"
Eureka,2000,Shinji Aoyama, ★★★★½ ," I had never felt so much pain. Eureka is quite a traumatic experience, in a good way, as it grabs you with all the technical elements, including the sepia tonality that I don't remember seeing a movie completely in that color. It is a masterpiece that should be recognized more in our days.Final Score : 90% 🍎 ***"
Eureka,2000,Shinji Aoyama, ★★★★½ ," Wow.Maybe not perfect, but like, it’s one of the better films I’ve ever seen. Moving on from trauma is something I have fortunately never had to truly deal with, however, I felt the despair that these characters felt, along with the illogical and beautiful reason to live: for others. I admire the visual storytelling, immensely. ***"
Eureka,2000,Shinji Aoyama, ★★★★ ," The emotional crisis these characters are facing is presented as PTSD, but the film works perfectly as an illustration of a classic Sartrean existentialist thingie; they're confronted -- BAM! BAM-BAM! -- with the nihilist void of absurdity that social constructs protect us from recognizing, and they spend three and a half hours trying to regain their equilibrium. The narrative's pretty wispy, but it's carefully observed and very 'real'. Shot for shot, it's one of the most beautiful pieces of filmmaking you can imagine, up their with your Tarkovskys and whomevers. ***"

Eureka,2000,Shinji Aoyama, ★★★★½ ," Trauma is deeply rooted and can negatively affect someone's life. Eureka is a simple yet complex story about trauma survivors who try to cope their trauma and to survive their daily life. Sawai attempt to help Tamura sibling (and himself) from their severe suffering, by letting them feel, letting them do what they want, letting them to lean on someone who they trust, by taking time to feel better, and by confronting the trauma together. ***"

Eureka,2000,Shinji Aoyama, ★★★★★ ," This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  We need some time to find ourselves.Eureka is a film about trauma, and even though it may look depressing, I think it's far from that, it's a hopeful journey, with a runtime very well justified because it's not an easy one, it takes time. You need time to move on, to help yourself and others. Sawai show us how empathy can defeat cynicism and apathy and how we can help each other out through our worst moments, if we actually try hard enough.  ***"
Eureka,2000,Shinji Aoyama, ★★★★★ ," A plea for empathy, to overcome the crushing throes of grief, to help others and, in doing so, help ourselves. This is a film full of hope—hope for the future, hope for each other, unimaginable hope for the human species and the triumph we bring to each other. A snapshot of grief as a seemingly impassable, and debilitating, but catalyzing incident, one that transforms us in distinctly different ways but charges us with empathy regardless. The complete antithesis of nihilism and perhaps the most achingly humanist portrait of collective trauma and healing ever crafted. ***"

Some Like It Hot,1959,Billy Wilder, ★★★★ ," I know Some Like it Hot is considered “one of the final nails in the coffin of the Hays Code” for obvious reasons, but it’s actually kind of fun to rack up just how many other “rules” this film breaks concerning over twenty years of censorship. A five-minute make-out session with both figures in a reclining position. A throwaway line that includes the word “pregnant”. The bust of that Marilyn dress. It’s like the perfect meeting point between the old studio system era and the New Hollywood of the late 60s. ***"

Some Like It Hot,1959,Billy Wilder, ★★★★ ," Gender sickos infiltrate a biological female space and use their innate male advantage over women to do farcical flim-flams and hysterical hi-jinks in this comedy classic. Jack Lemmon as a woman is pretty nice with it though.UPDATE- Love how sadistic Tony Curtis is in this movie to Jack Lemmon, he steals from him at every turn and then pimps him out to a weird old man. I also love his Cary Grant impression when he pretends to the Shell Oil heir. ""Water polo? Isn't that terribly dangerous?""""I'll say. I had two ponies drowned under me."" ***"

Citizen Kane,1941,Orson Welles, None , William Randolph Hearst you absolute milksop. If young Orson Welles was playing me in a movie I would do everything in my power to make sure it got out there. Who gives a shit if it’s about me dying alone? You see that guy? That’s a hot guy! ***
Rififi,1955,Jules Dassin, ★★★½ , this movie was really good but i have to talk about the old guy during the discussion in the theater afterwords who didn’t understand how foreign language films and subtitles worked and it had to be EXPLAINED to him. he was like “did they remake it for american audiences? but how are we understanding what they’re saying? it’s not in english?” ***
Rififi,1955,Jules Dassin, ★★★★ , A pretty straightforward heist film that is more about the inevitable tragedy of the hyper-masculine gangster lifestyle than anything else. Great music! Beautiful shots! An extremely unlikable protagonist and a tense final few minutes that made me say “good lord” out loud in anticipation! My first child shall be named... Rififi! (Hope it’s a girl!) ***
Rififi,1955,Jules Dassin, ★★★★ ," ""The rules."" ***"
Rififi,1955,Jules Dassin, ★★★★½ , Everyone focuses on the heist sequence and rightfully so because it is simply amazing. The whole film is gripping from back to front but the complete lack of dialogue and music during the heist is exceptional because the audience is so honed in on the sound as you are on the edge of your seat because the set up of the alarm is so masterful. Fantastic film that was the genre blueprint for everything that came after. Check it out if you haven’t. ***
Rififi,1955,Jules Dassin, ★★★★½ ," I loved this so much. Beautiful and suspenseful and without giving too much away, a perfect justification for why you need 11 guys to pull off a heist! 4 is not enough!! ***"
Rififi,1955,Jules Dassin, ★★★★★ ," In the last 30 minutes I felt like I was short of breath, and in the last 3 minutes I couldn't breathe anymore ***"
Rififi,1955,Jules Dassin, None , If I was every heist movie that came out after this I would also be inspired by it. Like all those Received Pronunciation rockstars who give interviews about hearing Elvis on the radio. ***
Rififi,1955,Jules Dassin, ★★★★½ ," The Better Call Saul writers talked about how much this was an influence on all the ""Mike meticulously solves a problem"" sequences, and they were obviously right. The movie loses a little steam once the heist is over, but that part alone is an all-timer. ***"
Rififi,1955,Jules Dassin, ★★★★ ," yesss my favorite genre, four dudes pulling off a bank heist in complete silence ***"
Rififi,1955,Jules Dassin, ★★★★★ ," What a masterpiece! I guested on The Twin Geekscast to talk about this movie as well as Fantasia Festival and Japan Cuts (and more). Join myself, David and Calvin right here, or wherever fine podcasts are found. ***"
Rififi,1955,Jules Dassin, ★★★½ ," In the classic 50s heist films sweeptakes, Rififi is neither as deeply felt as The Asphalt Jungle nor as perfect design a fate machine as The Killing (althought it feels more authentic fatalist), it makes up for that by having the best imagine seedy underworld. The major heist is still a marvel (f a very selff conscious showy moreabout minimalist filmmaking spectacle than criminality) and the sadness of the actions still register strongly. ***"
Rififi,1955,Jules Dassin, ★★★★ , this movie has one of the tightest screenplays i’ve ever come across and is only made even better by the characters constantly referring to the only italian in their group as “spaghetti” and “macaroni” instead of his actual name. ***
Rififi,1955,Jules Dassin, ★★★★ ," A tragedy! And a famous heist scene. Very methodical, almost felt like a tutorial. Check your watch often and remember, not too loud now. Always keep an eye on the time, keep an eye on the schedule. No words needed, only the periodic clank clank clank. It's like Thief, it reminds me of Un Flic. I guess Rififi is the mother of them all, Dassin's out there setting standards for crime films despite being blacklisted by Hollywood. Ending was superb and climactic. Classy, thrilling french noir. ***"
Rififi,1955,Jules Dassin, ★★★★★ ," I don't know why this is but the French were somehow able to capture our crime movies perfectly, in some cases even improving on the form - movies like this are free of any of the false sentiments that sometimes plague even the finest authentic noirs (you will never see an earnest plea to appreciate your local police force in a French crime movie). Here is exhibit A, case in point, ipso facto, addendum et monumentum - a coldblooded, fat-free caper that makes fatalism exciting and vice versa. ***"
Rififi,1955,Jules Dassin, ★★★★★ ," Jules dassin masterpieceThe most interesting part of this film is the spare dialogue and an entire, long sequence which shows every move of the robbery as it is carried out, with absolutely no speaking. Awesome!  ***"

Rififi,1955,Jules Dassin, ★★★★ ," Has one of the most nail biting heists I've seen in afilm, takes its time, has lots of realistic detail with lots of tension and no dialogue for half an hour.

Rififi,1955,Jules Dassin, ★★★★ ," ""à la Rififi"" ist durch den Film als Redensart übergegangen und bezeichnet einen Einbruch in einen geschützten Raum durch die Decke.

I noticed the bird costumes just like the birds in Wes Anderson’s Moonrise Kingdom. I saw things that reminded me of the films of Terry Gilliam, Jacques Demy, and many, many others.

I have experienced this again today with Marcel Carné's Children Of Paradise. Brilliant in every single facet. Normally, I try to write a lengthy, passionate review when awarding the full 5 stars to a new watch. But sometimes, a brief paragraph is all you need. ***"
Children of Paradise,1945,Marcel Carné, ★★★★★ ," Film 2 of 10 on theleopard's List for MeI have spent longer than the runtime of the actual film trying to find words to describe it, out of awed amazement, out of love, out of the feeling that only pure cinema provides. I have no words, so instead I will say this:There are some really obvious bulges in the first scene. ***"
Children of Paradise,1945,Marcel Carné, ★★★★★ ," Filme tem uma relação muito poderosa com a realidade dramática. Tanto no sentido de comentar isso diretamente (a relação com o teatro), como de propor uma narrativa romântica tocante. Existe um fascínio muito comovente pela natureza da encenação propriamente, por como o corpo e o tempo trabalham quando submissos a uma unidade narrativa absoluta. O romance entre Baptiste e Garance é muito revelador nesse sentido. Do primeiro ao último encontro, o Carné articula uma ambiguidade entre leveza e gravidade muito poderosa. Ao mesmo tempo que existe esse drama pesado e historicamente muito significativo, os personagens parece que levitam naquele mundo. ***"
Children of Paradise,1945,Marcel Carné, ★★★★ ," Your Favourite Films #103 - @StormofCuteness Technically incredible. How this was made in 1945 during the war period, I do not know.

Children of Paradise,1945,Marcel Carné, ★★★½ ," Poor Nathalie...A classic soap opera elevated by great performances and especially Prévert's wonderful script. The dialogue is truly Chef's kiss™While a bit too long and I didn't think the second part was as compelling as the first, this remains a classic of French cinema worthy of its reputation, and definitely one of the most iconic representation of Parisian theatre! ***"
Children of Paradise,1945,Marcel Carné, ★★★★ , 80/100C'est absolument incroyable..First part is totally flawless. Second part drags a little but overall still an excellent piece of work. It's so enchanting. Carné/Prévert do the thing once again. (Port of Shadows is still the pinnacle of poetic realism) ***

At some point in France this was voted the best French film of all time and I get it becauses it's an epic film that is immaculately made and features interesting characters. I can't quite go 5 stars because I really felt the length and probably should've split it up into parts. Minor problem though, this film is outstanding. French people are alright after all. ***"

Saving Private Ryan,1998,Steven Spielberg, ★★★★½ ," ""No good deed goes unpunished"" is formula for most of this movie, which I guess approximates the stupidity of war. A pile of cliches but you've got to respect Spielberg for cramming so many in. The juxtaposition between near-constant immorality and the patriotic message is striking. Still, the final battle is so interesting that I was completely on board. When Old Damon is sad at the end I was almost crying while whispering ""This is stupid"" to keep my ironic distance. ***"
The Elephant Man,1980,David Lynch, ★★★★ , David Lynch didn't fuck with my mind this time...he fucked with my heart 💔 ***
The Elephant Man,1980,David Lynch, ★★★★ ," There's a stretch of a few minutes near the end of this where ""my friend"" is uttered by four different people with four very different contexts and meanings and I was very moved by it. Simplicity I guess is what you would call this but I think the way Lynch opts for grace and patience is not as easy as it looks, there's real meditative poetry in these images and performances that I think others would've missed even if given the same material. ***"
The Elephant Man,1980,David Lynch, ★★★★★ ," my heart...the pain, sorrow, suffering, fear, and even joy that john hurt portrays with only his eyes is truly something to marvel at.another lynch masterpiece. ***"
The Elephant Man,1980,David Lynch, None ," When I was a kid, my dad would occasionally say “I am not an animal!” in the John Merrick voice, if we were at the zoo or watching something about a person in confinement. My dad isn’t much of a cinephile and I doubt that he knows who David Lynch is. But he clearly saw this and took something from it. I should call him and ask.Beautiful film, one of my favorites. ***"
The Elephant Man,1980,David Lynch, ★★★★½ ," the only david lynch film i've seen that hasn't left me very confused after watching it, it just left me very sad ***"
The Elephant Man,1980,David Lynch, ★★★★½ , The Greatest Showman but if it was not pandering and was actually empathetic and didn’t paint an exploitative dirtbag as a hero or oversimplify complex issues down into vapid pop songs but instead interrogated the savior complex and our reactions towards people who are “other” than us and therefore truly celebrated what it means to be human.**Correct. I do not like the movie The Greatest Showman. ***
The Elephant Man,1980,David Lynch, ★★★★ , david why u always gotta mess me up like this ***
The Elephant Man,1980,David Lynch, ★★★★ ," Eraserhead was Lynch's first major display of his penchant for surrealism, but this film introduced another important quality of his work: A keen understanding of the human condition, particularly in its reaction to the grotesque. ***"

The Elephant Man,1980,David Lynch, ★★★★½ , I said awww out loud so many times for various reasons like I would say awww when someone would do something sweet for John (Elephant Man) and when he would just be so kind. I loved him. But I would also say awww in sadness when people would fuck with him. I really loved this I did not expect it to be so sad or for David Lynch to make me cry like a bitch ***
The Elephant Man,1980,David Lynch, ★★★★½ ," I could rave in detail about John Hurt, Anthony Hopkins, the direction, the cinematography, the emotion and pretty much everything else. But I think I’m going to leave it at this:Everyone should see this heart wrenching film. Literally any human being who can. Please see it.It’s that simple.Lynch Ranked List ***"
The Elephant Man,1980,David Lynch, ★★★★½ ," Lynch's vision on Eraserhead convinced several recognized auteurs that he was the proper man to direct this shocking and heartbreaking tale. Although sometimes considered as the ""least Lynch"" movie after The Straight Story (1999), The Elephant Man holds a place among his truly memorable efforts. Some surreal fragments are still visible in a couple of scenes and his ability to touch the people's hearts is considerably remarkable and, quite frankly, unexpected.94/100 ***"
The Elephant Man,1980,David Lynch, ★★★★½ ," “People are frightened by what they don't understand.”This is my first David Lynch film and I really liked it. Now I’m really excited to watch the rest of them. This movie show us the reality of the human race. We see kindness, violence, mercy , hypocrisy , greediness, and sympathy. John Merrich the elephant man is a good man who lived in ill , deformed, disabled society. ***"
The Elephant Man,1980,David Lynch, ★★★★ ," Obviously not typical Lynch, but he still pulls off the standard narrative quite well, even if he can't seem to resist sprinkling in a few signature dreamlike touches.I really can't emphasize enough how delightfully understated both Anthony Hopkins and John Hurt are in this film. An outstanding exercise in empathy. ***"
The Elephant Man,1980,David Lynch, ★★★★½ ," quando ele falou que não era uma aberração e que era um ser humano eu não aguentei, chorei muito, a trilha me lembrou muito a de jack mãos de tesoura, e esse final dele falando que se encontrou e deitando na cama...n tô bem. ***"
The Elephant Man,1980,David Lynch, ★★★★½ , A simple story that is touching because it is instantly relatable and is infinitelyelevated through an unforgettable performance by John Hurt.John Merrick was shamed and ridiculed for being a hideous creature and was lavished by high society for being a resilient wonder. Two sides of the same coin.Highly recommended! ***

The Elephant Man,1980,David Lynch, ★★★★½ ," ""My life is full, because I know that I am loved.”Such a beautiful and touching film, a true lesson about humanity. The direction from David Lynch is admirable and the choice to shoot the film in black and white was perfect, as it’s a depressing representation of a man’s suffering and how despicable people can be towards others. Anthony Hopkins was really great portraying ‘Dr. Frederick’ but John Hurt stole the show as ‘John Merrick’, perfectly capturing the pain and vulnerability of his character. ***"

Sweet Smell of Success,1957,Alexander Mackendrick, ★★★★★ ," J.J. lords over everything, his face almost always in shadow and glasses cover his eyes. Sidney lurks in the background, wringing shaky hands. And the city like a prison, a dungeon. An edge of your seat thriller with no action or mystery beyond who's going to get destroyed next, every line of breathtaking dialogue a cobra strike.

Sweet Smell of Success,1957,Alexander Mackendrick, ★★★★★ ," The type of movie you need a cold shower after to wash off the scummy feeling of seeing bad guys do worse and worse things to the harm of everyone around them - most of all themselves. Tony Curtis and Burt Lancaster are absolutely terrifying and deliciously reprehensible throughout. Curtis’ self-destructive ambition feels like the grounding point for so many protagonists in decades to follow, from Walter White to Jordan Belfort, who are (to some odd sense of tragedy) undone by their own means. ***"

Winter Light,1963,Ingmar Bergman, ★★★★½ ," 89/100As the light reaches in through the windows, those who pray cower in their respective pews. Although the sun shines, everyone understands that the outside world is one of shivering bitterness and modern gasps of fear. Clinging, clinging, clinging to someone who will listen, quietly hoping for a reply within the shattered chambers of the church. The silence gives way to hardened spouts of regret and anguishing periods of hopelessness, but then again, does that even matter when one still happens to listen and the snow continues to descend? ***"
Winter Light,1963,Ingmar Bergman, ★★★★★ ," “It’s a hideous parody when you ape her.”“I never knew her.”the issues of man conflated with the issues of God. spending your life praying for something you don’t believe in, a fate worse than hell. a film haunted by the silence. ***"

Winter Light,1963,Ingmar Bergman, ★★★ ," A film that is pure stagnation. The purest self-abandonment, strictly apathetic, quite ruthless, almost apodictically apocalyptic. This is so unpleasant because the film refuses any kind of dynamic. The shots are tormenting in their weight of meaning, although they are 'filled' with emptiness. The complete absence of communication, of exchange of feelings, icy coldness in sacred walls. Noble conceptual art, but so infinitely exhausting and depressing, because there is no way out of the end of every human relationship, not through talking at least (rather only through silence). Excellent Christmas movie. ***"
Winter Light,1963,Ingmar Bergman, ★★★★ ," Gunner Bjornstrand, don't you DARE hurt Ingrid Thulin like that! She deserves to be happy, damnit! ***"
Winter Light,1963,Ingmar Bergman, ★★★½ ," A grounded, well crafted character exploration which is clearly personal to Bergman. It’s chilling and intriguing, but honestly dragged for me from time to time, which is odd given the runtime. Not quite the level of the other Bergman films that I have seen so far, but still a nice (depressing) watch. I am tired though, so there’s that. ***"
Winter Light,1963,Ingmar Bergman, ★★★ ," And on the seventh day, Bergman said, “Let there be existential crisis brought on by a deterioration of spiritual faith” and there was existential crisis brought on by a deterioration of spiritual faith.

Winter Light,1963,Ingmar Bergman, ★★★½ ," My first Ingmar Bergman, no I’m not joking, and immediately impressed by the layers of his dialogue and the performances. The Jesus bit at the end is some 5/5 stuff and in general this is practically First Reformed, but better. It’s also funny that both films have mediocre endings and in general the same flaws. Some have a problem with connecting with Ingmar Bergman’s movies, but I thought this was great ***"
Winter Light,1963,Ingmar Bergman, ★★★★ ," So quiet, so cold, so lonely, so broken, yet so full of understanding.Bergman is certainly at his bleakest here but it's still in service of a larger message. If God is really gone then all we have left to lean on is each other. ***"

I think this is my favorite Bergman and I liked it so much it makes me want to revisit some of his stuff that I was just lukewarm on.

The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,2013,Isao Takahata, ★★★★½ ," top tier Ghibli. Takahata's devastatingly great watercolor and charcoal folklore feels at once both ancient and alive. a little bit of flab in the middle (though it suits the fable-esque nature), but the last 20 minutes make up for the screechy first 20 and any pockets of trouble in between. and omg that scene where she runs away from the palace and the image practically decomposes. ***"
The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,2013,Isao Takahata, ★★★★★ ," This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  As a parent, I'm dreading the day my daughter grows up and ascends to the moon on a chariot of clouds.Isao Takahata's watercolor and sketch animation is so consistently beautiful it threatens to become mundane (ho hum, another gorgeously composed and colored shot) and then he throws something truly magical at you, like shadows dancing in the forest, or cherry blossoms, or light twinkling on a jeweled branch or that final, 2001-topping shot.

The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,2013,Isao Takahata, ★★★★★ ," ""All this happiness that you wished for me has been very hard to bear.""An absolute knockout of a film. Beautiful to the extent that I got chills at multiple points just from the images alone. Every frame feels so lovingly drawn, and the details in the character's eyes just make their emotions feel all the more real. ""The Tale of"" is an essential part of this title, as the film very much feels like a tale as old as time unfolding in front of your very eyes. Magical. ***"

The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,2013,Isao Takahata, ★★★★½ ," Eight years in the making. The most expensive Japanese film ever. A charcoal and watercolor organism alive with supple, deft brushstroke breaths. Radiating emotion, fluidity, stillness, velocity, nature and spirit. A great poetic keen over life’s impermanence, which, of course, makes the work itself timeless. Once I started to cry over the animations of artisans making simple wooden bowls early on, I knew I was in trouble. If I couldn’t even get through that most deft and simple glance at the film’s essential humanity then I was going to be an emotional fucking wreck by the time it was done with me. I was not wrong. ***"

I think some of the characters and relationships are severely underdeveloped, but Barbie’s journey of self-discovery is told in such an meaningful way, it’s hard to imagine anyone not walking out with a huge grin on their face. I also think we have enough evidence to continue casting Gosling in more comedic projects, the guy is a hoot. Excited to see Snyder cultists and (far right) men lose their shit. ***"

Umberto D.,1952,Vittorio De Sica, ★★★★★ ," Too devastated to come up with anything coherent now. Poverty, loneliness, depression, eventually with some hope and redemption at the end, its unfortunate we don’t get films like this anymore.

Umberto D.,1952,Vittorio De Sica, ★★★★½ ," There’s an astonishing image – especially for a 1952 film largely shot on actual locations – of the distraught Umberto standing within feet of a train as it barrels past him, the dust suddenly engulfing him and obliterating any sense of the real world. It’s a jarring, jostling picture of a man who has been cast into a dehumanizing vortex, largely because of others’ indifference.My full review here. ***"

Umberto D.,1952,Vittorio De Sica, ★★★½ ," ""Everyone takes advantage of the ignorant"" -Umberto, Doggo!!!!This is a very good film but it failed to completely grab me. The cinematography is beautiful and the flowy story structure really worked but there was something missing that I can't quite put my finger on. Despite a strong script I just never quite cared about Umberto as much as I'm meant to. This could be because I spent the whole time worried about the dog so maybe a second viewing is in order at some point. Good movie, just wanted a little more. ***"
Umberto D.,1952,Vittorio De Sica, ★★★★½ , For a life of uncertainty is somehow still worth a try... ***
Umberto D.,1952,Vittorio De Sica, ★★★★½ ," I still need to dive deep into Italian neorealism, but with ""Umberto D."" I am off to a brilliant start in this poignant, tender, and warm tale about resilience and human-canine bonding.Amazing how such a simplistic story has so much of an emotional and nuanced burden to it, this thanks to the incredibly talented people behind the film and the way it was executed because it could have easily fallen into sentimentality, but De Sica's eye for subtleties and mundanity makes for a raw and beautiful portrayal of elderly life in postwar surroundings. ***"
Umberto D.,1952,Vittorio De Sica, ★★★★½ , this literally broke my heart no one talk to me..... he just wanted a room and his dog :( ***
Umberto D.,1952,Vittorio De Sica, ★★★★ ," When you are old, you don’t have much left. You have to appreciate the small things. Umberto D. teaches us that. Umberto doesnt have much to love, but Flike, and that makes his relationship to Flike so strong, and poignant. It’s truly beautiful, and everybody with an animal will understand and relate to this, at some point. Also if you have a grandfather or a grandma, try to put them in Umberto’s place and you have yourself a strong film. ***"
Umberto D.,1952,Vittorio De Sica, ★★★★★ ," ""No, they don't get used to it.""as resonant a plea for empathy and basic human decency as any in cinema. the final 20 minutes tore my heart out. ***"

Cure,1997,Kiyoshi Kurosawa, ★★★★★ ," Ringu if the thing that perpetuated death was not a mystical force but our own complicity in seeking out violence. A film about repressed Japanese id that feels disturbingly universal in how it depicts that the mere suggestion to be oneself might unlock our basest evils. Kurosawa is the best director of horror since Polanski, a filmmaker who does not jolt or shock but instead places everything in the frame, or just tantalizingly outside it to the point that you can't stop yourself from craning your neck as if you might be able to peek around the corner. ***"

Cure,1997,Kiyoshi Kurosawa, None , what i love about These Dark and Sexy Detective Movies for Boys (i'm thinking specifically of skjoldbjærg's 'insomnia' as well) is how fastidious capital-s visual Style creates a canvas against which hot middle-aged men in impeccably-tailored overcoats can get a little fucking crazy on the clock. a little chiaroscuro to make the psychosis pop all the way off! cool ***

Cure,1997,Kiyoshi Kurosawa, ★★★★★ , Kiyoshi Kurosawa whittles the police-serial killer procedural down to its essence. By investigating the killer you risk becoming a monster so Kurosawa asks his audience what then do we become when we watch stories of extreme violence? The camera turns back to look at us. ***
Cure,1997,Kiyoshi Kurosawa, ★★★★★ ," Do you ever wake in the middle of the night, hear a sound in your home and become convinced that there's someone downstairs? Your heart starts to beat faster, the hairs on your arm begin to stand, your breathing quickens.This film is that sound in the night.This film is that feeling in your bones.This film is that person in your home. ***"
Cure,1997,Kiyoshi Kurosawa, ★★★★★ ," Compelling mind-twisting serial killer(?) puzzle. Feature films that are capable of transcending their own genre are admirable for their accomplishments. What starts as a regular detective thriller unravels into a complex exploration of self discovery and the definition of the own identity. Heidegger would empathize with Kurosawa, perhaps, as the answer can only be found at the end of the path to Grace.96/100 ***"
Cure,1997,Kiyoshi Kurosawa, ★★★★★ ," A city on fire of invisible flames. Bark psychosis. There's a force here that wants everyone dead. Kiyoshi Kurosawa asks: who are you? The biggest joke of it all: nothing. Philosophy to the max. Hypnotizing to your true self. A lighter that never goes out, it only does so by an unknown black substance, only to linger on in you forever, this is what Cure is. Violence here isn't like how other films do it, just the cause of something that cannot be controlled. Kiyoshi Kurosawa is a director that needs more recognition. My favorite post-rock horror film.X ***"

"Life, and Nothing More...",1992,Abbas Kiarostami, ★★★★★ ," Moving forward. A film that accepts that life is much larger than itself, as generous as the heart of a child and as beautiful as the world that surrounds us.

"Life, and Nothing More...",1992,Abbas Kiarostami, ★★★★½ ," Really too massive to properly comprehend in full on first viewing, Kiarostami is doing so much here and presents it all so quietly and simply. The struggle - and indeed, harmony - between movement & stillness (and reality & fiction of course) represented with tremendous weight through delicate conversation, gentle action and framing so perfect you don't even realise it. ***"

"Life, and Nothing More...",1992,Abbas Kiarostami, ★★★★½ ," Only the second Abbas Kiarostami film I had the pleasure of experiencing. It is always great to go out of a movie learning something without getting preached at. Such a calm, genuine and sensible film, which after watching some of his Interviews, is what I'm guessing describes Abbas Kiarostami pretty well, also. ***"
"Life, and Nothing More...",1992,Abbas Kiarostami, ★★★★★ ," The poetics of healing on the long and winding road of life. And just like that Kiarostami creates the entire universe in a summer day. Life is to move forward. To be kind, to search for beauty in all of life's heartbreaking ugliness and to help as many people as possible. From every tragedy and heartbreak, we are in this together and life is far bigger than death. The sun will set and rise again, the land endures and so do we. Ozu is alive, a miracle of a film. ***"
"Life, and Nothing More...",1992,Abbas Kiarostami, ★★★★½ ," It’s amazing how this film manages to be so comforting while it shows the aftermath of a devastating earthquake. The destructiveness of nature is balanced with its beauty and human resilience. The camerawork is so simple and natural, but so effective at showcasing the world of the film. ***"
"Life, and Nothing More...",1992,Abbas Kiarostami, None ," Kiarostami bends reality here again. I was hit with a profound sense of deja vu as the scene rehearsed in Through the Olive Trees played out here as it was supposed to.

The Bridge on the River Kwai,1957,David Lean, ★★★★★ ," David Lean strikes again! The Bridge on the River Kwai is a masterpiece in pacing, performances, and scripting. This is a war movie that does not focus on gun fights, explosions or violence of war per se, but the futility of it and the arrogance inherent in manmade destruction. Part adventure, part humane allegory, the film is also a deeply ironic portrayal of stubbornness and persistence. Performances are all perfect, photography is legendary, and the entire production is just suffused in an epic scale that only Lean that deliver. The film is cinematic in ways that other films don't even come close to achieving. ***"

The Bridge on the River Kwai,1957,David Lean, ★★★★★ ," Love it. David Lean, you absolute legend.Manages to walk that tricky tightrope of epic and intimate like only a true master can. Leaves us with such impressive scale and scope that doesn't skimp on the humanity, making it all the more impactful. Yet it does it all so effortlessly with rarely a wrong foot placed, it actually makes me a little dizzy to mull over the preciseness with which it's all been crafted. Amazing. Doubtful if I'll see something that will sweep me sideways quite as successfully again this year. A new fave! ***"
The Bridge on the River Kwai,1957,David Lean, ★★★★ ," The Bridge on the River Kwai spends most of its considerable running time puffing up a romantic image of the British gentleman soldier, presenting an organized, highly capable military man who handles ever situation—even time as a prisoner of war—with civility, decorum, and perseverance. Then the movie dedicates its final moments to detonating its own stiff upper lip.More here: www.larsenonfilm.com/the-bridge-on-the-river-kwai ***"

The Bridge on the River Kwai,1957,David Lean, ★★★★★ ," One of the greatest films ever made and endlessly watchable. Alec Guinness leads an impeccable cast, everyone does perfectly with the material they’re given. Guinness himself gives one of the greatest performances in the history of film. The symbolism and messages are powerful and ever relevant. Perfect film! ***"

Secrets & Lies,1996,Mike Leigh, ★★★★★ , I can believe it won the Palme d'or for the cafe scene alone. There are very few performances better than Brenda Blethyn's. Maybe none. Enough said. ***
Secrets & Lies,1996,Mike Leigh, ★★★★★ , some of the best performances ever captured on film ***

Secrets & Lies,1996,Mike Leigh, ★★★★★ , Manville showing up for all of seven minutes and knocking it out of the park ***
Secrets & Lies,1996,Mike Leigh, ★★★★ ," Wow, the amount of times Brenda Blethyn said sweetheart or broke down in whimpering tears! It was a bit dated and melodramatic but I enjoyed it and found it quite moving at times. ***"
Secrets & Lies,1996,Mike Leigh, ★★★★½ ," Watching the cold, carefully constructed facade of distrust and detachment crumble as the uncontainable core of warmth and love bursts through to the surface… it’s a beautiful thing, sweetheart. ***"

Secrets & Lies,1996,Mike Leigh, ★★★★ , Incredible performance. Leigh knows how to just stand back and let the actors do the work when needed. ***
Secrets & Lies,1996,Mike Leigh, ★★★★½ ," A subtle, mature and realistic drama, that revolves around a broken family and the disconnect they face by hiding their secrets. The character detailing, family dynamics and performances were top notch, making the film so intriguing to watch. The long take during the climatic birthday party was staggering, as it builds upon its tension effectively with an earnest end. A strong melodrama with convincing emotional beats.‬ ***"
Secrets & Lies,1996,Mike Leigh, ★★★★★ ," that diner scene when cynthia is uncontrollaby laughing and then starts weeping all in one emotional spectrum... oh man. most harrowing part, though, was when graham took my gum out of me mouth and started chewing it himself ,,,wtf. 35mm. Quad Cinema. ***"

Secrets & Lies,1996,Mike Leigh, ★★★★★ ," Brilliant. It’s Mike Leigh’s masterpiece. A beautiful, small and wholly real film with stunning performances and memorable characters. Brenda Blethyn is a force of nature, truly one of my favourite ever performances by an actress, just absolutely wonderful from beginning to end, and funny as hell she is, good lord the laughs. ***"
Secrets & Lies,1996,Mike Leigh, ★★★★ , World’s worst birthday partyBABY MOMMA DRAMA 8 ***
Secrets & Lies,1996,Mike Leigh, ★★★★★ ," Secrets & Lies is one of those rare movies that doesn’t feel like it needs to manipulate its audience to illicit emotion. It’s just honest. Mike Leigh has made a unique film in that regard. The acting is some of the best I’ve ever seen. Brenda Blethyn, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, and Timothy Spall are all Oscar worthy performances that bring these characters to life. At times I would forget these are just actors saying words on a page. This is a real family with real love, real issues, real feeling. I loved this so much. One of the most honest and moving films I’ve ever seen. ***"
Secrets & Lies,1996,Mike Leigh, ★★★★★ ," A touching film and a surprising treatment of racism in a conservative English medium, a wonderful embodiment of the meaning of identity and self-definition within the framework of social class..A very realistic performance that transcends borders from Brenda Blethyn and a great victory of human feelings against prevailing norms.""Secrets and Lies"", a social drama about the reality of loneliness, pain, passion and care, one of the best film I've ever seen!Final Score : 💯 🍎 ***"
Secrets & Lies,1996,Mike Leigh, ★★★★★ ," For some reason I decided I needed this today. Secrets & Lies is the sort of film that Hollywood not only doesn't make but can't; it's an industry that just isn't equipped to explore ordinary people in a believable way. Leigh's dismissal of the sentiment that a major American studio would have brought only bolsters the success of his film's emotional impact, and if everything feels a bit too neat and tidy at the end, it's a small price to pay for the way it makes you feel. Plus, it's really the getting there that counts: Blethyn, Spall and Jean-Baptiste are phenomenal.Previous review ***"

The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya,2010,Yasuhiro Takemoto, ★★★★★ ," I really don't know what to say...

Brigade these past two days. I wouldn’t trade it for anything... Thank you for this adaption, KyoAni. I loved everything about this quirky series. To cap off The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya with a near-three hour Christmas movie is not what I expected, but then again you can’t really predict anything from these guys.Rest in peace, Takemoto Yasuhiro. Thank you... this movie will stand eternally as a pillar of film and art. ***"

Happy Together,1997,Wong Kar-wai, ★★★★½ ," When Al Pacino said “The eyes, Chico, they never lie”, he was referring to Tony Leung’s. ***"
Happy Together,1997,Wong Kar-wai, ★★★★ ," If there was one word to describe every Wong Kar-wai film it’s longing. Longing for another time, longing for another place, for how things used to be, for how you hope they can be again, for how you know they can be again, longing for happier days, longing for restful nights, longing for anyone, longing for someone specific, longing for each other. Life feels marked by periods where love is present and love is away and Wong Kar-wai’s films are no different. ***"

Farewell My Concubine,1993,Chen Kaige, ★★★★★ ," Leslie Cheung was truly extraordinary. Who else could give such a fragile performance, like a pendulum swinging from one extreme to the other?

Farewell My Concubine,1993,Chen Kaige, ★★★ ," A story of abused children growing up to be oblivious if not downright stupid adults lost in a world they have no hope of understanding. As decorous and nonsensical as any Hollywood historical epic, which is I guess a kind of triumph. Imagine how unwatchable this would be without brilliant actors like Gong Li, Ge You, Zhang Fengyi and Leslie Cheung chewing up the frame and giving it some sense of moral and emotional clarity. ***"

Farewell My Concubine,1993,Chen Kaige, ★★★★ , Femboys just can't catch a break ***
Farewell My Concubine,1993,Chen Kaige, ★★★ ," An interesting period drama as it crosses different moments in China's political and cultural history during the 20th century (from the 20's to the 70's precisely) which I admittedly don't know much about. While a bit too broad and long, its melodramatic aspects work enough to get us through the runtime. Leslie Cheung is excellent as the lead and Gong Li manages to be memorable in the always difficult ""3rd wheel in a love triangle"" supporting role. ***"

Your Name.,2016,Makoto Shinkai, ★★★ ," Gonna be honest, really wish I liked this a bit more.It felt like 5 different types of movies were happening and as a result it came out messy. Like it was one build up of piano music after another that each lasted 5 minutes and got irritatingly repetitive after awhile.

Manages to blend a number of genres and concepts together while remaining cohesive throughout.

Once Upon a Time in America,1984,Sergio Leone, ★★★★★ ," I’m so annoyed at myself for putting this film off. Everyone should see this film. The camerawork, the editing (especially the transitions), the acting and the story telling is just too good. It’s what all films should be like. I wish there was more of Joe Pesci but we got a shit load of Robert De Niro so we good. I enjoyed the crap out of this film and I’ll probably be thinking about it for a very long time. ***"

Once Upon a Time in America,1984,Sergio Leone, ★ ," I've been trying to watch this film for a few days now and after 2 and a bit hours I gave up.The first hour was terribly boring, the second was more entertaining and I thought we were getting somewhere and then as I started my third part, there was 2 rapes within 20mins, one which the woman apparently enjoyed when she remembered back to it and the second of a woman that the character allegedly loved. I stopped it on the second one and don't intend to go any further.I don't care how popular it is. ***"
Once Upon a Time in America,1984,Sergio Leone, ★★★★★ ," so many parts of this turn into a horror film on the second watch. leone is unmatched when it comes to incisively displaying the desperate, flawed humanity of americana: this is his saddest work by far, the foibles of 20th century politics a direct symmetry of individual failings, the reoccurring memories of a person's entire life embalming them within a narcotic haze. fate isn't ordained by any higher power; it's the unconscious patterns that you can't help but repeat over and over and over again. ***"
Once Upon a Time in America,1984,Sergio Leone, ★★★★★ ," ""This country is still growing up. Certain diseases are better to have while you're still young.""Leone's totemic visual language services one of cinema's most ""literary"" depictions of subjective experience: generations, movements, and revolutions swirling on the peripheries of an existence in hell.

From the nostalgia, that the movie creates itself (it doesn't borrow it from other sources like most flicks nowadays do) to the despicable acts carried out by REAL gangsters, none of that criminals-with-high-moral-and-principles bullshit to ""Noodles"" denying Max's existence, which should be up there for saddest movie-scenes of all time; this movie is just perfect in my humble opinion. ***"
Once Upon a Time in America,1984,Sergio Leone, ★★★★½ , #2300Once Upon a Time in America might be the greatest gangster epic of all time. It certainly ranks among Leone's best and Morricone's score is unbelievably good. ***
Once Upon a Time in America,1984,Sergio Leone, ★★ ," De Niro has never been so dull on screen.Yeah, I said it. No, really, I said it on Filmspotting #792 during our 8 From '84 discussion. I appreciate Leone's attempt at a more philosophical reflection on violence and American corruption and greed, his desire to demythologize the gangster lifestyle. But these characters are worse than just unrepentant and irredeemable - they're uninteresting.Young Patsy not being able to resist devouring the pastry with that Morricone score though... alone almost justifies at least another half star. ***"
Once Upon a Time in America,1984,Sergio Leone, ★★★★½ ," After deeply regretting his decision of refusing the chance to direct The Godfather (1972), Leone embarks us on a journey of deeply universal themes, from the most violent, masochistic and depraved ones, to the substantially beautiful, visually. An almost perfect cinematographic achievement with audacious expressionistic tendencies that border on the overtly contemplative is noticeably exalted by its glorious score thanks, once again, to the exquisite work of master Ennio Morricone. Oh, what a delightful gangster epic!92/100 ***"
Once Upon a Time in America,1984,Sergio Leone, ★★★★★ ," Once upon a time in America is no doubt a masterpiece. Everything about this movie will stick around in my brain for a long long time. It just goes to show how quick your life can fly by. This might be one of the longest films I’ve seen, clocking in at just under 4 hours, but boy is it worth it. Sometimes there are movies where it feels like words don’t justify how good it is, and once upon a time in America is just that. Bravo 👏. ***"

Once Upon a Time in America,1984,Sergio Leone, ★★★ , This took me 11 days to watch. It's like the godfather but with a boat load of rape. ***
Once Upon a Time in America,1984,Sergio Leone, ★★★★★ ," The greatest gangster film whose title does not start with 'The Godfather', and one of the greatest accomplishments of the cinematic medium. It's a quite difficult film to watch (for about 8 different reasons), but it also features some of the most impeccable cinematography and music that you will ever see or hear. This is a full-blown masterpiece. ***"
Once Upon a Time in America,1984,Sergio Leone, ★★★★½ , A hauntingly poetic and beautiful epic about vile loathsome creatures driven by greed and passion. Leone’s decade-spanning final achievement is going to stay with me for a few days. ***
Once Upon a Time in America,1984,Sergio Leone, ★★★★★ ," I've viewed pretty much the main body of Sergio Leone's work. Once Upon a Time in America is the best of them all. In my mind, now, I don't think any gangster film will ever top this. Including The Godfather. Also including The Godfather Part II.At a four hour run time, you would expect to get restless... right? Wrong. The time just... passes.Perfect in almost every way. ***"

The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance,1962,John Ford, ★★★★★ , The American movie. ***
The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance,1962,John Ford, ★★★★★ ," The appearance of John Wayne and James Stewart in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance accentuates the diverse concepts in play in this western directed by John Ford. It’s adapted from a 1953 short story written by Dorothy M. Johnson, and it principally examines the evolution from rugged frontier individuality to enlighten law and order. With a script by James Warner Bellah and Willis Goldbeck, it’s one of Fords masterpieces and intrinsically one of the cornerstones upon which his huge reputation’s constructed. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is beautifully shot and stars two actors in the September of their years delivering sterling performances. ***"

The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance,1962,John Ford, ★★★★★ ," Fracasso progressista como mito fundador do estado?Talvez seja um filme mais maquiavélico do que de fato pessimista. Já que a vitória progressista se dá muito mais em um tom de resignação, quase de mito armamentista, do que de uma prosperidade limpa. Lembra bem Fort Apache nesse sentido, a vitória da presunção conservadora que, quase que por uma inversão de valores, acaba ajudando na construção de um mundo mais civilizado. ***"

El western contó todas sus historias. Se construyó y deconstruyó de la mano de John Ford hace más de 60 años, no nos quieran vender más pescado podrido. ***"
The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance,1962,John Ford, ★★★★★ , John Ford’s simple clarity of direction and language entwine the fates of a man and a country. The Western genre is at its best when its characters’ destiny becomes inseparable from the vast landscape they inhabit. Nobody understood this better than John Ford. “The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance” speaks its truths about democracy and justice with the pure visual poetry from which the greatest of American legends are derived. ***
The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance,1962,John Ford, ★★★★★ ," John Ford constrói o mito fundador do Estado americano. Imprensa e a lei contra o Estado de exceção. Elas sozinhas, porém, podem vencer a violência que se instala?O pessimismo que se constrói ao final - a vitória só se deu pela violência, que impulsiona a amargura do líder que tem a lei como álibi - se mistura com um idealismo utópico do progresso. O herói se cria pela mentira. E então Ford não está falando apenas do Estado americano como foi, mas como é. ***"

The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance,1962,John Ford, ★★★★ ," Less overtly flashy and cinematic than The Searchers, and takes a while to settle into its pace, but nevertheless a solid Western from John Ford. Stewart and Wayne are a stellar duo, and Lee Marvin brings a charismatically brutish gravitas to the titular villain. I really liked this. It's subtle and quiet and thought-provoking in a different manner than the other Ford Westerns I've seen. ***"

The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance,1962,John Ford, ★★★★½ ," This is probably my favourite John Ford film I've seen so far.Jimmy Stewart is definitely beyond the point of too old for the role of a young man fresh out of law school, but the most hilarious casting is the (very obviously) 50 year old O.Z. Whitehead playing the role of a teenage boy. ***"
Make Way for Tomorrow,1937,Leo McCarey, ★★★★½ ," 86/100Take any film with a flood scene in it, imagine that you could transfer that body of water into your tear ducts, and then watch Make Way for Tomorrow. Build your ark now, because you won't know what hit you. *tears start welling up*Not again.... ***"
Make Way for Tomorrow,1937,Leo McCarey, ★★★★½ ," You don’t see a lot of popular films commenting on old age, but Leo McCarey’s Make Way for Tomorrow is such a moving tribute to that. The two main actors (who are twenty years younger than their characters) give an accurate and convincing performance as grandparents, and the aging make-up effects are fantastic. It’s a devastating film that pulls at your heartstrings when it effectively raises awareness on the common lack of empathy towards seniors. It’s about the decline of a family, how elders are discarded, and the young spirit that is yet still lurking inside old people. ***"
Make Way for Tomorrow,1937,Leo McCarey, ★★★★ ," i always sense that people are cupping their hands & trying to hold onto hours, so the time doesn’t slip between their fingers. and memory acts as this tub that you don’t want to let the water out of. so much of our life is seen backwards, but there is something really sweet here about preserving time in each second. and accepting that going forward, in opposite directions, may be the only way to reach each other again. ***"
Make Way for Tomorrow,1937,Leo McCarey, ★★★★★ ," Apparently Orson Welles called this ""the saddest movie ever made."" I completely agree. McCarey's comedy background makes him the perfect filmmaker for this, as his approach is completely free of false sentiment or straining for effect. Most old Hollywood movies, even the great ones, are characterized by their artifice, but this is the rare one that seems completely real thanks to the unusually naturalistic performances from the case and an abundance of true-to-life details. ***"

I'm not going to use this film as a podium for my argument against the War on Sentimentality, because this film deserves better than that. And Jesus Christ. This film is sad. Not sad in the Hallmark movie way. Sad in the way in which Leo McCarey delivers the COLD HARD TRUTH. It's brutal. In any economic crisis, the first to suffer are the old, and even when they've put so much into their children and livelihood, it's all for nothing. All they can live on is memories. Fuck.

Underground,1995,Emir Kusturica, ★★★★★ ," Underground is a (nostalgic??) homage to a national land that no longer exists despite its turbulent sociopolitical background. Kusturica breaks any possible boundary and increases the size of his scope gigantically, orchestrating a massive masterpiece of satirical humor, theater, war, Communism, music, trumpets, social criticisms, animals, sex, dance, kids, teens, betrayal, love, lust, surrealism, beautiful landscapes, war ruins, hilarious sound effects, WWII, audacious stunts, metafilm, slapstick violence and a monkey. Breathtaking and wall-shattering spectacle for the reflection of modernity!!98/100 ***"

Underground,1995,Emir Kusturica, ★★★★½ ," Gravity's Rainbow for Eastern Europe's identity crisis. In my opinion, it does not trivialize the Bosnian War then raging so much as it sublimates the horrific endgame of Yugoslav identity confusion into a broader history of irreconcilable farce. The entire film bursts with a sense of buried tragedy, one where the absurdity of Yugoslavia's failure to adequately resolve its many ethnicities is proof of a childish primitivism that would have unfathomable consequences. ***"
Underground,1995,Emir Kusturica, ★★★★★ , Upon rewatch I can safely say that this is an absurdist masterpiece. ***

Underground,1995,Emir Kusturica, ★★★★★ ," Plasma las desgracias de la sociedad humana con un humor simple, inteligente y audaz.Utiliza un ""simbolo"" Yugoslavo de la libertad y el poder para demostrar la decadencia humana, su avaricia, esclavitud, estupidez, hipocresía y ambición. Por otro lado, el uso de simbolismos para fortalecer el mensaje y la conexión con el espectador, es un simple recurso que Kusturica aplica muy bien en este film.Los personajes logran conectar tanto, que el par de muertes que tanto ansiaba no las disfruté tanto como creí que lo haría, sin embargo esto es bastante positivo y le agrega más sustancia a la película de lo imaginado. ***"

Underground,1995,Emir Kusturica, ★★★★ ," The third act took this film from good to great in my view, but I think I'll get more out of it on a second watch. The film's tone is a weird mix of serious and completely absurd. It deals with war, family, propaganda, and filmmaking, and I think that I'll love the film more after I read up on it and on 20th century Yugoslavian history. It's got a ton of charm and it's generally a very fun film.It was funny seeing the main actor from A Serbian Film play as the dumb son, though. ***"

This is the one of a kind of mind-expanding experience that only occurred to me after I finished a Jodorowsky film, and it has happened again now. Absolute bonker stuffs happened in this film, and perhaps the only true thing to do is to label it as a satire and laugh it off but it just feels too important to do so. I'm definitely lacking in this sort of historical and cultural knowledge so I'm just going to accept my ignorance and shut tf up, read some reviews and treasure this transcendental experience for now. ***"

Fallen Angels,1995,Wong Kar-wai, ★★★★½ ," I didn’t really know how to sum up this film until the very last minute. It proves that finding love is a trial and error process that could either take a long time or it could happen instantly. No matter how many times you get denied by another person or things just don’t end up working out, there will always be a special someone out there. You just need to find them. ***"
Fallen Angels,1995,Wong Kar-wai, ★★★ , Can we talk about how cool this movie looks ***
Fallen Angels,1995,Wong Kar-wai, ★★★★★ ," ""I finally fell in love for the first time.""Always leave it to WKW to subject us to the emptiness of space and see how under great tensions, due to our implacable desire to connect, our bodies are forced to collide, compensate and feed off one another. Fallen Angels always gives me that buzz, the feeling of being held, and today was no exception: I had a chance to celebrate my birthday with the people that I love, a chance to see Michelle Reis leaning her head on Takeshi Kenashiro's shoulder, and most importantly, I felt loved again. ***"

"4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days",2007,Cristian Mungiu, ★★★★½ , Bro the last 30 minutes of this movie had my heart RACING. This was so so intense in the best way. I felt so much empathy for these characters and the way we followed their story made me feel so connected to them. I feel like my heart is so heavy right now but this film was so beautiful. This is so important and I think everyone should see it. Let women be in control of their own bodies!!! ***

This is a very well made film about an interesting topic and that makes it good. 4 Months' strength is its intimate portrayal of a difficult journey.

"4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days",2007,Cristian Mungiu, ★★★★½ ," I’m writing this review a few days after I watched this and it’s still hard to put into words the way this movie makes you feel. Easily one of the most uncomfortable movie experiences I’ve ever had, but still an amazing film nonetheless. The camera work is chilling with the way it stays completely still at certain points, or when it shifts to the handheld camera when she’s running. This is one of those films that everyone needs to see at some point, especially pro-life advocates because when abortion is illegal this is what happens. ***"

"4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days",2007,Cristian Mungiu, ★★★★ ," Letterboxd Season Challenge - Week 4: Romanian New WaveLong takes, long silences, the slightest movement of a ""still"" handheld shot, the complete lack of score or artificial lighting- it all adds up to a super poignant minimalist film. This film gets very bleak and viscerally unnerving at points, with a sequence towards the end of the film packed full of as much suspense as your favorite horror movie. Not going to be jumping at the opportunity to rewatch this one anytime soon, but any fan of minimalist/slow cinema should definitely give this a watch. ***"
"4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days",2007,Cristian Mungiu, ★★★★ ," The powerful subject matter at the centre of 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days was brilliantly realised, and as a result the film was a thoroughly intense and poignant experience. At no point did it feel excessively dramatised or clichéd; and the minimal story, simplistic setting and small cast of characters helped keep everything focused and visceral. Anamaria Marinca's performance was also stellar, which was the cherry on top. ***"
"4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days",2007,Cristian Mungiu, ★★★★★ , As brutal and nerve-wracking as this is I always love revisiting it. I don't hesitate one bit to call this a masterpiece and a masterclass in suspense. Most of it is handheld with really long takes which add so much to the oppressive atmosphere of 1980s Romania. ***

The Cremator,1969,Juraj Herz, ★★★★★ ," A concentration camp survivor reworks the horrifying wide-angle, POV subjectivity of something like Peeping Tom to fit the snarling, darkly comic, absurdly disturbing headspace of a compulsive, obsessive cremator who views his craft as an art, gradually morphs into a tool for/the arm of the genocidal Nazi machine, and may or may not think he's the next Buddha due to his occupation of ""liberating"" souls from their bodies. An unbearable, close-proximity depiction of how evil can delude itself into thinking it’s actually a work of purity and spiritualism with very few psychological and ideological tweaks. Full discussion on ep 219 of my podcast SLEAZOIDS. ***"
The Cremator,1969,Juraj Herz, ★★★★★ , Has the exact feeling one would expect from a movie that was locked in a vault for 20 years. To my knowledge this is also the only Holocaust related film made by a survivor too which just gives it an even more eerie feeling. ***
The Cremator,1969,Juraj Herz, ★★★★★ ," Probably the best movie I've ever seen made by someone other than Rainer Werner Fassbinder about how little effort it takes to push the average man from their socialized notions of patriarchal authority and even mild economic stability into the realm of outright fascism. And where Fassbinder approaches this subject via studio-era melodrama, Herz does it via Eastern European psychological thriller, so that the film seems to eat itself as an already unbalanced man fully slides off his axis. ***"
The Cremator,1969,Juraj Herz, None , If I hadn’t known this movie was banned in Czechoslovakia and kept hidden away for twenty years I would’ve guessed it was. Almost have to wonder what it looked like before it went in. It feels warped by its time alone in a vault. ***

This is what it was like in Czechoslovakia before it dissolved in 1993? The whole thing feels like a demented dream that you are hesitant about but just let happen to you. It's creepy, it's beautiful, it's interesting and it's entertaining. Rudolf Hrušínský will be in my nightmares for years to come and I'm looking forward to it. I need to check out more Czech cinema apparently. Yes. ***"

Frenzied cutting to scan the formal geographical rooms of the warped mind. Scenes lock on to each other like a whole monologue. Projected into the underworld levels. The thinking is extreme. As they said: ""Serve the nihilistic pleasures"". But horrifyingly enough, we're trapped in here with them. ***"

The Cremator,1969,Juraj Herz, ★★★★½ ," I can't believe I slept on this film for so long. It's a haunting gothic tale about a cremator during the rise of Nazi Germany. The elliptical editing, haunting music, and great performances make the film feel like a nightmare or fever dream. I'm a sucker for films about descents into madness, but this has to be one of the best of those sorts of movies that I've seen. ***"

The Cremator,1969,Juraj Herz, ★★★½ ," 64/100Anticipates The Conformist (which premiered just 16 months later) in both its portrait of an ""ordinary"" man's moral descent and its striking formal aggression. Bertolucci's is by far the greater achievement, simply because dramatic subtlety and verisimilitude render this particular subject far more chilling; it's hard to watch The Cremator and wonder whether something like the events depicted might genuinely have happened. Still, the fever-dream version boasts singular virtues of its own.(Rest of the review, along with everything else I write, available via ultra-cheap subscription. Seriously, it’s as little as $1 a month and for now that pays my rent.) ***"
The Cremator,1969,Juraj Herz, ★★★★ ," This is an awesomely subversive and dark movie. It's basically an arthouse horror movie but with that 60s Czech charm. The main character is an insane sadist cremator. There are so many great scenes with him. My favorite is when he held up a cat and told it that after he cremates it won't recognize itself. It's as messed up as it is funny, and although it's funny it holds some strong commentary. It's amazing. Added to THE 60s ***"
The Cremator,1969,Juraj Herz, ★★★★★ ," 10/10Shoutout to @spingy19 for the request.There are dark comedies, and then, there are pitch black dark comedies. The Cremator is the latter. The evils of the Holocaust get turned into a bleak horror, as our cremator protagonist slowly spirals into insanity. I would say more, but that would spoil the movie for you.SPOILER WARNING (KINDA):This hits a bit different after hearing about that one guy who killed his kids because Qanon conspiracies told him they have serpent DNA. ***"
The Cremator,1969,Juraj Herz, ★★★★★ ," one of the finest antifascist films ever made. while some films simply stare into the void, this one dives deep into that inky blackness at some point, from which it never returns.the formal aspects of this are all pretty incredible, but this might be one of the best edited films ever. it especially shines in its scene transitions which are so mind-blowingly smooth I often didn't realize a new scene was happening until a few seconds in. ***"
The Cremator,1969,Juraj Herz, ★★★½ ," It’s good but I wasn’t blown away. I can see that The Human Centipede 2 took some pointers from this no doubt and if not intentionally than good on Tom Six, it works.I like the narration, it’s very similar to how the writing is in Wings of Desire. One man talking over images about whatever the hell he wants always makes for more cogitative exposition.Overall it works, the fisheye lens cinematography is always creepy especially when paired with a seedy character such as Kopfrkingl and the Nazi angle, while an angle I hadn’t been expecting, certainly helps to deliver on the “horror” aspect of this. ***"
The Cremator,1969,Juraj Herz, ★★★★ ," Often on the nose and repetitive, but still plenty haunting and fucked up. I'm always more inclined to enjoy Holocaust films focusing on the gestation of fascism rather than the emotional pornography of more modern films, with cloying narrative twists about humanity and ""goodness."" Perhaps they are an attempt to give life to victims, but it strikes me as revisionist at best and disrespectful at worst. Juraj Herz, a survivor himself, instead creates a metaphysical explanation for some of humanity's darkest creations. ***"

Napoleon  is full of energy, extravagance, ambition, and great drama; nonetheless, the narrative itself didn't appeal to me like at all.

Napoleon,1927,Abel Gance, ★★★★★ ," This is the definitive Film Epic. In my opinion, every epic from Gone With The Wind to the 2012 Les Miserables takes after this movie. It's such a grandiose story to take on and yet Gance comes closer to capturing Napoleon's life than any film to come after. The camera work is just as ambitious. The movement of the camera is so fluid in capturing the action and the use of handheld shots is striking and adds a huge layer of depth to the atmosphere of certain scenes. It's engaging throughout and easily one of the greatest/most impressive movies of the 20s. ***"
Napoleon,1927,Abel Gance, ★★★½ ," I feel like I just climbed Everest. I watched that Michelle Obama video of her congratulating me 12 times in a row. I did a victory lap around my backyard.But I didn’t really like the movie.I understand it’s merits and I appreciate the scope, but it’s so unengaging. I couldn’t connect with any of it (except Robespierre’s killer costumes) because the performances were so thin and the direction was too vast for its own good. The scenes didn’t come together to form a cohesive story. It just didn’t succeed for me. ***"
Napoleon,1927,Abel Gance, ★★★★★ ," Haphazard memories & forgotten victories, this is history. ***"
Napoleon,1927,Abel Gance, ★★★★½ ," Of all of those silent movies that are heralded as super influential, this is the one that has the most ""how the hell did they do that?"" moments of innovation. Super ambitious (to a punishing degree), everything about this sprawling masterpiece is grand in nature. From the enterprising direction and editing to the pioneering camerawork, this should be the defining epic of the silent era. ***"
Napoleon,1927,Abel Gance, ★★★★★ ," This film is incredible. I'll admit, it was beginning to lose me after a while, but towards the end, it does something completely unprecedented for the time, and it does it in the most ingenious of ways.You probably already know what I'm talking about, but if you don't, you're in for quite a shock. I knew it was comming, but seeing it play out before my eyes was truly magical.A technical masterpiece.Five and a half hours well spent. ***"

Amour,2012,Michael Haneke, ★★★★★ ," Perhaps the most accessible film in Haneke's repertoire but no less devastating! In fact it was too painfully real! The film makes one pause briefly to contemplate their own mortality! The actors gave incredibly strong performances!

The performances were some of the best I’ve seen in recent memory, and some of the shots Haneke got (especially the last one) truly reminded me of paintings.

It's dark, funny, just really sad and in some ways I related to the characters. Mary and Max are both not perfect just like any of us. They're both lonely and long for friendship. So they write letters to each other where they share about their life and become pen pals. It's wonderful. The voice acting is so great and the animation too.

Samurai Rebellion,1967,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★½ ," this matter of honor and fealty is also one simply about protecting a loved one. but a woman is still a bargaining chip here. exalted as a mother and a wife, the spiritual center of a family but not its decision maker, the heart if never its head. yet her power as a source of emotional and pragmatic strength isn't entirely negated by her status as a commodity, and her willing participation in this ritual is intrinsically a part of it. everything and nothing. ***"
Samurai Rebellion,1967,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★★ ," despite being in a no-win scenario, regardless of being subject to impossible tyranny, you cannot deny your own individual agency and will. intensify the contradictions, heighten the stakes, make your enemy lose just as much as you have to. even the odds; force the move. ***"
Samurai Rebellion,1967,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★ ," No freedom allowed, but in death. A high aestheticized purge. Everyone be it man, woman, samurai and even lord slaves to the same social theatre careful rendered by Kobayashi staging. The formal key might be the occasional empty shot he uses for punctuation which add an aspect of world outside the Langian nightmare of Kobayashi’s mise en scene. Even the outside shots here suggest a grave. I guess one might question how much Kobayashi is enclosing his characters in a tomb as larger as the society structure he is denouncing, but from my part I’m just impressed by his commitment. ***"
Samurai Rebellion,1967,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★½ ," Heavy on the dialogue and captivating, Samurai Rebellion is a tale of love, friendship and abuse of power. Not a lot of characer development (except for the main three) but with Masaki Kobayashi's biggest middle finger to authoritarianism. ***"
Samurai Rebellion,1967,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★★ ," Meet the Old BossUp to the final scenes this is almost completely action-free, but the way the drama is staged and the tension is accumulated is totally riveting, really expert stuff. To my western ears anyway, the title ""Samurai Rebellion"" calls to mind a successful rebellion, triumphant in its defiance against an unjust power structure. The reality here, as I should have guessed before the movie even begun, is much different, although the power structure is as unjust as I could have hoped for. ***"
Samurai Rebellion,1967,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★½ ," The Criterion Challenge 2021: Round 3Kobayashi does Samurai and jidaigeki films better than Kurosawa. There, I said it.Continuing with his trademark themes of honour and justice, Masaki Kobayashi curates another gripping tale of humanity. Courage and resolve in the face of tyranny and systemic adversity, Samurai Rebellion's power lies in the hearts of its characters, led by an awe-inspiring performance from the great Toshiro Mifune. Topped off with some outstanding cinematography and a vivid score from the legend that is Toru Takemitsu, Kobayashi proves himself to be one of Japan's best, despite a relatively minimal filmography. ***"

Samurai Rebellion,1967,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★★ , One of Toshiro Mifune's finest work yet? This might have a lot to do with him being heavily involved in this film as a producer therefore he would have more enthusiasm than a normal samurai film. Couple that with the fact that he was really experienced by this point and he cements this as one of his GOAT performances.Everything else was exactly as I expected from Kobayashi. His usual cinematography style and control of pacing is present here. I gotta calm down and stop watching these downer films for a while. ***
Samurai Rebellion,1967,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★ , Kobayashi makes subversive samurai movies with big hearts. That's exactly why I love them. I need to rewatch some Kurosawa because I definitely did not feel the same way about them and just assumed I didn't like samurai movies.I've re-completed the Letterboxd top 250 now! Yay! ***
Samurai Rebellion,1967,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★ ," More of a family drama film than a typical Samurai film, Samurai Rebellion pairs perfectly with Masaki Kobayashi's masterpiece Harakiri. Written by the greatest screenplay writer of samurai epics (Shinobu Hashimoto), Samurai Rebellion is a film about social restraint and resisting authority; themes that build and climax in a spellbinding sequence with excellent swordplay. Mifune is as good as always, and I was pleasantly surprised to see Gō Katō who I really enjoyed in one of the Lone Wolf sequels. Another absolute classic. I've said it before and I'll say it again - Kobayashi never misses. Check out my Japanuary list here. ***"
Samurai Rebellion,1967,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★★ ," Kobayashi é um gigante, me é inconcebível ele não ser tão bem quisto dentro do cinema japonês quanto Ozu, Kurosawa e Mizoguchi.Ele é o Shakespeare do cinema, tanto no lirismo da forma, quanto na tragédia da narrativa.A grandiosidade desse filme pode ser medida na descrição de uma cena: Mifune e Nakadai alimentam um bebê em conjunto antes de duelarem, esse pequeno momento exemplifica como um tôdo a grandiosidade por cada minuto do filme.DVD Versátil Cinema Samurai Volume 1. ***"

Samurai Rebellion,1967,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★½ , Hats off to u Masaki Kobayashi! ***
Samurai Rebellion,1967,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★½ ," While not as masterfully crafted as Harakiri, Samurai Rebellion is another remarkable effort from Masaki Kobayashi in critiquing the Samurai system. Also functioning really well as a family drama, especially in the context of 18th century Japan. Showcasing a dilemma of morals vs family honor, and standing up to a corrupt Daimyo. A fight for the right of individuality and to love who you please. While Kobayashi's filmography wasn't as expansive as Kurosawa or Ozu's, the feats he achieved with what his films tackled is just as incredible. Plus it has Mifune and Tatsuya Nakadai in a final duel, how can it not be amazing? ***"
Samurai Rebellion,1967,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★★★ ," An altogether different beast from Harakiri.This Code of Samurai life delves deep into honour,tradition and familial politics;setting up the stage for a heartbreaking finale. As for it's leading protagonist he is nothing short of riveting.This winner of the Fipresci Prize at the Venice Film Festival is worth a watch. ***"
Samurai Rebellion,1967,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★½ ," Steve's Priority Watchlist ProjectI get what everyone sees in Samurai Rebellion but I just found it really difficult to get in to.I couldn't escape the feeling that this was talking itself round and round and round and while that may well be the point of the whole thing, I found it a huge slog that picked up a little bit towards the end. Not for me. ***"
Samurai Rebellion,1967,Masaki Kobayashi, ★★½ ," A colossal disappointment. Harakiri or The Human Condition, this is not. It takes forever and five days to reach any interesting development, and another ice age passes before the underwhelming finish. This is just simply not an engaging film, and an observable downgrade in virtually every way from Kobayashi's aforementioned masterpieces. Skip it. ***"

Satoshi Kon's gorgeous animation and compelling, emotional story are aided by a wonderful score to make for one of the best anime features I've ever seen. Highly Recommended. ***"

Rosemary's Baby,1968,Roman Polanski, ★★★★ ," The energy radiating off this thing is so unwelcoming and uneasy but so interesting. I feel like a lot of that comes from the performances, they were all so bizarre but so right. Felt like 90 minutes! One of the coolest movie posters ever also. ***"
Rosemary's Baby,1968,Roman Polanski, ★★★★ ," ""I dreamed someone was raping me.""last time i watched this, probably 15 years ago, it bugged me. Rosemary's lack of agency felt dated, kind of a variation on that thing where some old thriller could never work today because cellphones. by some probably very rigid reckoning of representation she seemed remarkably passive. i feel stupid about that now because that agency isn't missing, it's been taken, systematically stolen and then co-opted, which is of course entirely the point. ***"

Ritual,2000,Hideaki Anno, ★★★★★ , Anno probably could have just made blockbusters after EVA but instead he went off and made arthouse movies about being fucked up and lonely. God bless. ***
Ritual,2000,Hideaki Anno, ★★★★★ ," A review by way of Ingmar Bergman’s take on Ivan’s Childhood:“My discovery of Tarkovsky's first film was like a miracle. Suddenly I found myself standing at the door of a room, the key to which, until then, had never been given to me. It was a room I had always wanted to enter and where he was moving freely and fully at ease. I felt encouraged and stimulated: someone was expressing what I had always wanted to say without knowing how.” ***"
Ritual,2000,Hideaki Anno, ★★★★½ , the human heart is fragile and is easily captured ***
Ritual,2000,Hideaki Anno, ★★★★ ," A filmed dialogue about living. Film as sort of bridge of sorts between forms of behavior that exist in the outskirts of society, of the acceptable in way or another. Anno has a great eye, specially when applied to a series of coded gestures, a way of expression, ritual as the title promises and how he both locates and found a form to better give it room to breathe. ***"

Ritual,2000,Hideaki Anno, ★★★★★ ," A regular day (or dream) in Shunji Iwai's life. Tomorrow is her birthday, always. Red umbrella. Post-modernism spaces with trains and drawings. Communicating with the medium itself, film. Hideaki Anno's projected reality of the moving image, repeating rituals are human, and animation is the same as live action. Aching and lonely. Beyond this, however is unknown, but we all know to live and to be lonely is the meaning (to be human). The infinite sadness has a chance to get covered by the sky and the sun. This is a personal and collective fantasy one needs to experience. ***"

Tomorrow is my birthday, and I will circle that day, and that day will be the last time ***"
Ritual,2000,Hideaki Anno, ★★★★★ ," “You know what tomorrow is?””Your birthday.”trying to suppress emotion and trauma through false imagery and empty comfort, learning to survive once that facade begins to inevitably break. Anno hitting End Of Evangelion, Love & Pop, and this within three years is one of the greatest creative runs any artist has ever had ***"
Ritual,2000,Hideaki Anno, ★★★½ ," Iwai-anno is an irresistable duo but the ""depression single-handedly cured by protagonist"" trope left me unconvinced. I also hope they'd cut the film shorter, does look unique though, also ayako fujitano acted the shit out of this. ***"
Ritual,2000,Hideaki Anno, ★★★★½ , This is honestly one of the most beautiful and creative movies I've seen. I'll definitely rewatch it at some point. ***

Ritual,2000,Hideaki Anno, ★★★★★ , tomorrow is my birthday ***
Ritual,2000,Hideaki Anno, ★★★ ," Anno's art direction here is vividly honest - presenting lovely shot compositions and beautiful pianistic melodies to fit the aesthetics that contrast the darker themes at the film's core. It is an exploration of emotional introspection that illustrates escapism amidst a sea of melancholy, where our disillusioned protagonists find solace in one another while hiding away from their reality. Together they break out of a dreary existence shackled by loneliness - the perfect encapsulation of finding freedom with the only other person in the world who truly understands you. I only wish the ending did more for me. ***"
Ritual,2000,Hideaki Anno, ★★★★½ ," What a beautiful looking film.They could make an art book about the creative set design and the beautiful little insert shots alone. The film lost me a tiny bit towards the end, but it barely matters, I loved the mood of this, the gentle piano score, the shot where Ayako Fujitani runs through the building introducing those stunning sets, the long car shots, so much to love here if you're a visual person. ***"

Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans,1927,F. W. Murnau, ★★★★½ ," This film is 90 years old, yet such a beautiful and powerful film, an extraordinary technical achievement, and for me another proof that time has no bearing on quality. The tracking shot of them walking down the street, actually in the middle of the road with cars all over, and the city setting turning into a country side landscape and then back again into the city was just so stunning and remarkable. Timeless. ***"

Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans,1927,F. W. Murnau, ★★★★½ ," Vague hints of German Expressionism peppered over domestic drama, the tedium of marriage reconciled once faced with the prospect of loss. Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans is a nocturnal fairground of frightful twists and turns, its towering set pieces and timeless visual technique dripping with effortless style. George O’Brien’s lurking presence practically resurrects the image of Nosferatu, Janet Gaynor’s hysterical fear furthering the scare-factor. More than ninety-three years old and still immeasurable in its ability to surprise, Sunrise is surely silent film at its most vivid and powerful. A rip-roaring, thundering classic, demons of the night slowly dissolving into the light of day. ***"

Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans,1927,F. W. Murnau, ★★★½ ," ""Don't be afraid of me."" - man, Look, getting a pig drunk was funny back in 1927. The score is beautiful, the images are haunting, and it's pretty cool that this is one of the first ever films to use tracking shots. Sunrise is a lovely, and sometimes funny, story about romance and deceit and it kept my attention for the most part, which is not something I can say for all silent films. F.W. Murnau really understood how to craft a pretty shot and I'll always appreciate him for that. A silent film I can get behind. ***"

Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans,1927,F. W. Murnau, ★★★★½ ," Não lembrava como o filme era tão estilizado. A cópia restaurada revela ainda mais uma minuciosidade pictórica muito poderosa do Murnau , quase um maneirismo pré-moderno que não busca nem a caricatura expressionista e nem a glorificação plástica. Engraçado como ele é absolutamente irregular no seu tom - praticamente metade da obra é um interstício cômico isolado - mas que faz todo o sentido dentro desse equilíbrio inspirador entre liberdade criativa e controle dramático. ***"

Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans,1927,F. W. Murnau, ★★★½ ," I was so excited to watch this movie but unfortunately I didn't love it. The first 15 minutes and the last 15 minutes were really intense and interesting; however, the middle section felt like a bunch of side storylines to fill up the run time that didn't add anything to the overall narrative.

Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans,1927,F. W. Murnau, ★★★★½ ," ""AFI 100 Years 100 Movies"" completion - #29/100Rich, stimulating, and palpably evocative are some of the brilliant traits of ""Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans"". A film that gets its spellbinding strings and romantic finesse from its masterful performances and sensitive imagery instead of the source material.With the match made in heaven between the always imposing German expressionism and Hollywood's passionate romanticism, F.W. Murnau exquisitely orchestrated the figurative tone and visuals engrained in the almost intangible romantic tale, making for the ultimate display of poetry in motion.Remarkable. ***"
Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans,1927,F. W. Murnau, ★★★★½ ," Whilst the main character's relative ease at adopting murder as a way to change his relationship status may seem hard to swallow, the story is otherwise touching and well told. The film is beautifully shot and is probably the high point of silent Hollywood. Overall, Sunrise is an enjoyable and engaging piece of cinema that has deservingly stood the test of time.My Top Films of the 1920sMy Top Silent Films ***"

Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans,1927,F. W. Murnau, ★★★★½ ," There's a shot where the camera follows the characters walking across a street as all the cars are zooming past them. Then the environment disolves into a beautiful natural landscape before disolving back again into the street. You can tell how they did it, but it doesn't change the fact that it is absolutely stunning, especially for a movie from 1927. ***"
Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans,1927,F. W. Murnau, ★★★★½ ," Infectiously romantic, displaying the highest highs and lowest lows of a married couple in need of rekindling. Somehow, the film manages a convincing oscillation between brutally sad and cheerfully tender moments that occur within the same relationship in merely ninety minutes. Past its bitterest low, the film switches into an alluring tour of an ordinary honeymoon phase. Yet despite its commonplace scenario, it does a magical job at selling you the spark of love in the air. ***"
The Big City,1963,Satyajit Ray, ★★★★★ ," Once Arati leaves the home, an occasion Ray marks with a handheld camera that follows her along a jostling street, The Big City opens up into a full-blown exercise in mid-century film feminism, a companion piece in many ways to the work of Douglas Sirk. There’s a proud parade sequence in which Arati and her colleagues head out on the streets and Ray captures them, one at a time, walking with determination toward the tracking camera. The women are coming! The women are coming! Whether traditional Calcutta is ready for them or not.Full review here. ***"
The Big City,1963,Satyajit Ray, ★★★★★ ," Arati is the spiritual successor to PATHER PANCHALI's beleaguered Sarbajaya:You will not understand these things. You’re absorbed in your work. Sometimes you get paid, sometimes you don’t. I had dreams too, about all the things I would do.Did Sarbajaya's dreams include having a job outside the home, earning a living? We can never truly know, but the *I* is key. She would embrace life as an individual, separate from the responsibilities that culture and tradition dictate. Arati – who has a similar soliloquy early in THE BIG CITY – gets to live out that dream. For better and for worse.Tag: Masterpiece ***"
The Big City,1963,Satyajit Ray, ★★★½ ," social barriers, cultural rigidity, (silent) female uprising and male shamefacedness. the early filmic feminism is the striking theme, the loss of the male face in a patriarchal society though is the emotional core. a thesis film on point from a time when this was not considered a curse word. ***"
The Big City,1963,Satyajit Ray, ★★★★½ ," 88/100A.V. Club review. Was about to say I can't comprehend why this isn't universally regarded as Ray's masterpiece, but actually I can—it presumably seems too ""small,"" too comparatively inconsequential. I'll be arguing otherwise. ***"
The Big City,1963,Satyajit Ray, ★★★★½ , There's a reason Ray has been probably the most universally recommended director to me by my comments and patrons. And I regret putting off diving in for this long. Brilliant work. Can't wait to explore more. ***
The Big City,1963,Satyajit Ray, ★★★★★ ," On paper, it’s melodrama. Lives contorted into drama by coincidence, luck and accident. On screen, with every moment full of acutely observed life, it is a reminder that we’re all only a single event removed from the being thrown into embarrassing emotional extremes. Ray’s project may have been to capture a culture in transition, but what emerges is a definitive portrait of marriage and family life in all its subtly shifting power dynamics, secret shames, and acts of generosity and love. Simply one of the greatest films of all time. ***"

The Big City,1963,Satyajit Ray, ★★★★ ," Satyajit Ray's film takes on an even more special dimension today, when women are still being killed in some countries for daring to ask to be considered equal to men.A feminist film ahead of its time.Highly recommended. ***"
The Big City,1963,Satyajit Ray, ★★★★½ ," A gentle, unassuming domestic drama by Satyajit Ray in which, without you noticing, he dismantles colonialism, modernism, masculinity, consumerism, labor and any number of other powerful checks on individual happiness. Like Renoir, De Sica, Ozu, or Capra, Ray's extraordinary artistry flows directly from his humanism, and we're all the better for it. ***"
The Big City,1963,Satyajit Ray, ★★★★★ ," Breathtaking portrait of leading a life on the mercy of others. Poses and investigatives some potent problems that plague our nation and its working class with utmost restraint and a gentle, subtle touch. Peak, Ray right here. ***"
The Big City,1963,Satyajit Ray, ★★★★ , Ray was a pioneer in breaking regressive taboos long before it became a trend.He elicits a breakthrough performance from the stunning Madhabi Mukherjee.It's a bit overlong but a must watch nonetheless. ***
The Big City,1963,Satyajit Ray, ★★★★½ ," The Big City, directed by Satyajit Ray, is an empowering, humorous, and poignant look at a multigenerational working class family who struggle to make ends meet when they move to Calcutta from a rural village. The movie centers on the wife and mother of the family, Amati, who decides to take action and find a job to help financially support the family. She runs into cultural and familial obstacles in her quest for independence, especially from her husband and in laws. This movie is prescient in that explores hardships and injustices that women face even up to present times. ***"

The Big City,1963,Satyajit Ray, ★★★★★ ," Is there a better image for 20th Century feminism than a woman looking into a mirror holding the money from her first payday? Wow.Not the ending I was expecting from a story about female empowerment through employment, and yet the last 10 minutes are perfect. It's the next logical progression, but any other film ends before that sequence. ***"
The Big City,1963,Satyajit Ray, ★★★★★ ," My first Satyajit Ray, and on the level of filmmaking craft it lives up to everything I've heard about him. Gorgeously photographed and busy frames bursting with humanity, light, and shadow, just beautiful. And it's even more crowded with feeling on the story/character side - ""love each other"" sounds (and perhaps often is) a trite platitude but this is a great illustration of how a good 95% or so of the problems that arise from our own expectations and divisions would be conquerable if we'd just follow that one rule a little more religiously. ***"

STRANGELOVE, and FULL METAL JACKET he has a trilogy of sorts. The first part deals with the hypocrisy and tragic waste of war, the second deals with the comic absurdity of war, and the final part deals with the dehumanization of war and the struggle to maintain a sense of humanity and individuality in the midst of chaos and brutality. ***"

Aparajito,1956,Satyajit Ray, ★★★★½ ," Aparajito, the second film in Satyajit Ray’s Apu trilogy, opens with the camera looking out the window of a train, that symbol of modernity from Pather Panchali. As it races across a bridge and steel beams flash by, we leave the country for the city. Aparajito will go on to eloquently dramatize similar oppositions: tradition versus invention; religion versus science; adolescence versus adulthood. All square off in the life of Apu, and indeed in his heart.More here. ***"

There's a certain simplicity to it I really appreciate. The way it approaches themes of growing up and change makes it feel both timeless and universal. Really pretty score too and I'm very much looking forward to finishing the trilogy. ***

Aparajito,1956,Satyajit Ray, ★★★★★ ," Can’t believe Synecdoche, New York ripped off Aparajito ***"
Aparajito,1956,Satyajit Ray, ★★★★ ," From odds and ends of youth to the growth of faith and tribulation. Ray seems to understand that life gets more unfair with age, more of a sequence of toss-ups between doom and fortune that comes swiftly after the immaterial bejewel of early childhood. It gets worse as it gets better, and heritage is a grim lifelong weight burning as the future glides closer. Apu needs a prayer, a break, a stroke of mercy. Yet it doesn’t come. Only further dejection in a cruel, funereal morality play that he, nor his family, could ever opt out of. A curse from the moment of conception. Fun! ***"
Aparajito,1956,Satyajit Ray, ★★★★½ ," I liked it more than the first one.It's more focused and better paced.While Pather Panchali mostly took place in just one location, in this movie the characters are constantly going from one place to another.This makes sense, since Apu is now a young adult and his life is rapidly changing, which keeps the film moving and it never feels like it drags like the first one sometimes did.Amazing. ***"

An Autumn Afternoon,1962,Yasujirō Ozu, ★★★★★ ," Poem written by Yasujirō Ozu on the death of his mother in 1962:Down in the valley it is already springClouds of cherry blossoms;But here, the sluggish eye, the taste of mackerel -The blossoms are melancholyAnd the flavor of sake becomes bitter.[Note: 'the taste of mackerel' translates as 'sanma no aji', the Japanese title of An Autumn Afternoon] ***"
An Autumn Afternoon,1962,Yasujirō Ozu, ★★★★★ ," More drinking than a Hong Sangsoo film. Hilarious and devastatingly sad, often simultaneously. Ozu's most explicit references to the war, in a film in which almost every shot contains red, white and blue. The Battleship March is one of the great musical sequences. My favorite Ozu, the only one I've seen on film and (I think) the only one I've ever seen in a theatre. ***"
An Autumn Afternoon,1962,Yasujirō Ozu, ★★★★ ," crazy to see this and an Anderson film back to back – the colors, the framing, the dialogue, what goes unsaid until it's not ***"
An Autumn Afternoon,1962,Yasujirō Ozu, ★★★½ ," ozu’s shots of empty rooms convey so much emotion that is somehow shaped by the subject matter of each of his films. in this, they feel lonely, like you can feel the absence of someone. they show what happens when a room is left unoccupied — still there, but almost frozen, waiting for someone to come in and make them feel alive again. and what happens when someone leaves for good? when there are less people to bring that space to life? can the emptiness created by one being ever be filled? if you can’t feel their presence, at least you can feel their lack. ***"
An Autumn Afternoon,1962,Yasujirō Ozu, ★★★★ ," ""I won't shout it from the rooftops, but it's pretty nice. "" -Shin Horie, Metaphors!Watching an Ozu film feels like going to an intimate steakhouse with only a handful of tables and being told that the menu is only steak with potatoes and asparagus.... but then you have the steak, potatoes and asparagus and it ends up being like the best steak, potatoes and asparagus that you've ever had. An Autumn Afternoon is very good. ***"

An Autumn Afternoon,1962,Yasujirō Ozu, ★★★★ ," 72/100A.V. Club review. My favorite Ozu (possibly excepting I Was Born, But..., revisit pending), but ultimately his sensibility is just too sedate to ever push me beyond admiration into ardor. My loss. ***"
An Autumn Afternoon,1962,Yasujirō Ozu, ★★★★ ," ozu's films fill me with such comfort, even during the heartbreaking moments. at first i feel like an observer; an outsider peering into the lives of others. but, slowly the film wraps me up and makes me feel like i'm a part of these simple but profound little tales. an autumn afternoon is a beautiful depiction of changing post-war japan and generational/familial relationships, full of interesting characters and color that bring the story to life. ozu is on his way to becoming one of my favorite directors <3 ***"
An Autumn Afternoon,1962,Yasujirō Ozu, ★★★★★ , This is what movies are all about. 🥹🥹🥹 ***
An Autumn Afternoon,1962,Yasujirō Ozu, ★★★★ ," Last 30 minutes or so is peak Ozu. Knowing that this is his final film, released just a year before his death, makes the themes of this film (themes which Ozu had previously explored plenty) hit all that much harder. Makes me want to go sit on a mountaintop and stare at the night sky until the sun rises.×Japanuary 2023 #3 - Ozu >> Ranked #10 in my Directors League ***"
An Autumn Afternoon,1962,Yasujirō Ozu, ★★★★½ ," Hot sake, cold beer, baseball on the tv, talking shit about all our old professors. That's the life. Relish each day, and never be afraid to go after what you want, even if it might mean change. We all make compromises, and we're all built to adapt. Each new season in your life is a blessing.Yasujirō Ozu Ranked ***"
An Autumn Afternoon,1962,Yasujirō Ozu, ★★★★½ ," ""Alone, eh?""Ozu's last feature, An autumn afternoon somehow reminded me of his past works such as Late Spring and Early Summer. Both films were centering on the same issue, ""the arranged marriage of the daughter"". The thing that differs this film from those two was this film was already in color. I really loved the scenery of Tokyo in this one. Damn, even Tokyo in the early '60s was already looked so sophisticated and clearly ahead of its time 😮 ***"
An Autumn Afternoon,1962,Yasujirō Ozu, ★★★★ , this only runs for about two hours but i'm already so attached to the characters and the locations 😭😭😭 is this what ozu does to u?? ***
An Autumn Afternoon,1962,Yasujirō Ozu, ★★★★½ ," One of Ozu's most formally accomplished works. It's virtually flawless. Unlike many of his other late period films, this film actually isn't about the larger clash of traditional and modern values, as the characters are more complex, not as rigidly defined. Hence, there are not as many close-ups here, rendering the underlying emotions that much more devastating. A remarkable achievement. ***"
An Autumn Afternoon,1962,Yasujirō Ozu, ★★★★★ ," After i finished the film, i came to the conclusion that Yasujiro Ozu is the best director of all time. I cant believe i used to think his movies were boring at one point. ***"
An Autumn Afternoon,1962,Yasujirō Ozu, ★★★½ ," The closing moments do all the lifting that the rest of this pov (and era) shift from Late Spring daughter to father cannot do on its own. The bar patrons cutting off a nostalgia trip (not just of a navy tune but the barkeep who looks like a departed wife) by mimicking a radio broadcast of Japan's loss in battle. The empty corridors with soft light, catching the contrast of colors. I wish I'd felt this compositional high throughout Ozu's last film, perhaps it lacks the feminine touch for emotional connection, but the final moments are resplendent. ***"
An Autumn Afternoon,1962,Yasujirō Ozu, ★★★★½ ," Choses que j'aurais probablement dû faire plus tôt:1. Ouvrir un compte REER.2. Regarder des films d'Ozu.Je vous laisse deviner pour laquelle des deux je regrette le plus d'avoir autant tardé avant de m'y mettre (indice: mes parents ne partageraient probablement pas mon avis, mais en même temps ils n'ont jamais fait l'autre chose et je pense que ça pourrait (devrait) les faire changer d'avis de le faire).Aussi, ce film m'a vraiment donné soif (de découvrir les autres films d'Ozu, oui, mais surtout pour du saké, même si j'en ai jamais bu). ***"
An Autumn Afternoon,1962,Yasujirō Ozu, ★★★★ ," And with such love in their hearts, fathers will always speak Autumn onto their daughters. On the strength of sitting still was a memorial to that same old tradition of upholding for the sake of letting go, and looking back to reminisce on every season can only bring the most painful form of peace. Ozu left this world in 1963, on his 60th birthday, after a career of 36 projects. It was the simplest of times and the most formative of them all. The lantern has switched off but there will be another grip one of these days to reset it alight. ***"

Cléo from 5 to 7,1962,Agnès Varda, ★★★★★ ," Agnès Varda’s Cléo from 5 to 7 perceptively addresses it's concepts of existentialism as the lead protagonist waits to learn the results of a medical examination that may verify a diagnosis of cancer. It incorporates conversations of impermanence, and Varda’s high and voracious curiosity is evident throughout; she appreciates that the mundane possesses idiosyncratic attractions and wondrous curiosities. She contemplates the idea of despair and of operating a meaningful existence, This serves as a mission declaration of her filmmaking as a whole and represents a great deal which is favourable in the French New Wave movement. ***"

The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp,1943,Emeric Pressburger, ★★★★★ ," The ruthless force of nations rending through the years, the people see their countries changing into something unrecognisable but in fact it is they themselves who age, growing old beyond the days of pride for their noble cause, seeing war for what it is - a duel that only ends in loss. Yet the passage of time will carry love, friendship, her memory, delicately like a leaf on a lake, while the world marches on.Loved it VERY MUCH. ***"
The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp,1943,Emeric Pressburger, ★★★★★ ," A lot can be said about this masterpiece, but above everything, what strucked me as the most staggering of it all was her face moving beyond years, wars, culture, forever preserved for it's all there is. For love is the only thing that resists the march of time. Watching a leaf moving downstream amidst the reflection of the world above, I still haven't changed and I will never change. Thank you for making me keep up with everything even when the flood comes. And this is a lake, forever. ***"
The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp,1943,Emeric Pressburger, None ," cannot believe the grace here. it’s a war film in a particularly civilian atmosphere, using the grandiosity to suggest various levels of ideological devastation and complicity across lines, not centrist “both sides” nonsense but more this incredible synthesis of how we fight pure evil. no rationalist screed here, but a wisdom about fault that falls particularly sobering and effective in the context of being a WWII-concurrent production. moves, entertains, and provokes as good as anything I’ve seen. ***"
The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp,1943,Emeric Pressburger, ★★★★ ," ""Clive, My English is not very much but my friendship for you...is very much.""Shot in gorgeous Technicolor, replete with passion and still relevant themes, Powell & Pressburger's film is a profound and humanist reflection on war, friendship, integrity, patriotism, ageing, and also love. Being a perceptive and desolating evocation of human values and obsolescence in the wake of modernity, ""The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp"" corroborates itself as one of the finest films capturing the essence of Britishness while explicitly deriding the psyche of the British Military. ***"
The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp,1943,Emeric Pressburger, ★★★★½ , I have so many questions? Did Powell and Pressburger ever make a bad movie? Why is Roger Livesey's voice so sexy and is that why I'm strangely attracted to him? Barbara's house is Pemberley from the Pride and Prejudice mini-series? Why did Deborah Kerr in uniform restore my faith in humanity? How did Powell and Pressburger make technicolour look SO GOOD and how in the hell did they manage to capture natural light like that? Why am I crying about two old men? ***
The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp,1943,Emeric Pressburger, None ," The film has this endearing old fashioned quality to it, not in production (because, of course its production is old fashioned, I'm used to that) but in themes. It celebrates old fashioned values, but not bad ones, while simultaneously making an argument for evolving with the times. Besides that, it also illustrates a lifelong if long distance friendship that is the focus of the film in a way another film would have used a romance instead, and that is a quality I appreciate greatly. ***"

The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp,1943,Emeric Pressburger, ★★★★★ , Anton Walbrook’s monologue in the beginning of the third act is one of the most powerful and emotional scenes I’ve seen in a while and his performance honestly is what elevates this film to a solid 5 for me. I was gonna just write a joke review like usual for the movie until that scene happened and I just couldn’t not talk about it.Also this is a gay love story! ***

Kizumonogatari Part 3: Reiketsu,2017,Tatsuya Oishi, ★★★★ ," The first one was dedicated to tone/atmosphere and the second to fight animation/directing and this one is dedicated to characters: characters talking and interacting, I would say at least. Specifically, Hanekawa's character. Something about how she moves and talks here really connected with me in a way she didn't in the previous series, which makes her one of my new favorite characters. My expectations of this being a 10/10 were not met but I still had a fun time.Cool character designs, Mostly Talking, and Porn. Sounds like Monogatari to me. ***"

Kizumonogatari Part 3: Reiketsu,2017,Tatsuya Oishi, ★★★★ , The only problem with these movies is that now I want to go watch Bakemonogatari again but I should continue watching the series forward. ***
Kizumonogatari Part 3: Reiketsu,2017,Tatsuya Oishi, ★★★ ," overall Kizumonogatari was an adventure. liked the surreal stylism and the violence but could've lived without the 14-year-old boy levels of angst and horniness. The first two entries were great, this last one was... a trip. was def more enjoyable binging them all w other people. ***"

Kizumonogatari Part 3: Reiketsu,2017,Tatsuya Oishi, ★★★★½ ," A fitting conculsion for the cast in the movie. Bloodshed for a final fight in the Olympics that I wished guest started SpongeBob and Patrick fighting as well.Some wonky 3D CGI that took me out and some of that annoying placement cards getting in the way, but I left it entertained overall even with the fan service taking itself up to 11 in this for a long scene.Score is good, acting very well done. Animation always spectacular. One of the more better Vampire Animes out there. ***"

The Green Mile,1999,Frank Darabont, ★★★★½ , Wait... does John Coffey have the shining?One Movie Every Day 2021 ***
The Green Mile,1999,Frank Darabont, ★★★★ ," The first two hours of this movie walked so the last hour could run.Some truly incredible moments, mostly near the end. Michael Clarke Duncan’s acting is everything I was hoping it would be. He is purely angelic and makes you want to believe in the greater morals of the universe. I suppose I wish it was a tad more consistent. The old Tom Hanks part didn’t work quite as well. While much of it was crucial, the pacing early on could have been slightly accelerated. Really great one. I can’t believe it took me this long. ***"

The Green Mile,1999,Frank Darabont, ★★★★ , wow percy must be a real piece of shit for me to hate him more than several murderers ***
The Green Mile,1999,Frank Darabont, ★★★★½ ," The Green Mile is equivalent to running a marathon; you're drained by the end, yet grateful and satisfied for the experience. This is a beautiful, powerful piece of work with remarkable performances from Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan. ***"

The Green Mile,1999,Frank Darabont, ★★★★ ," I'm tired of people being ugly to each other. I'm tired of all the pain I feel and hear in the world every day. There's too much of it. It's like pieces of glass in my head, all the time.I remember waking up by night, reach to my grandmother and seeing her cry in front of tv, it was a long time ago but I remember thoroughly well it was the final scene of this movie, i never saw it entire, so watching today i've understand perfectly what she was feeling that day.A lifetime classic ***"
The Green Mile,1999,Frank Darabont, ★★★★★ , Another movie from the 90’s that is just simply perfect. Over three hours long but never boring. Tom Hanks at his best. A story filled with meaning. An emotional roller coaster. You can’t make movies like this anymore. ***
The Green Mile,1999,Frank Darabont, ★★★½ ," Films Watched in 2020 - Film 207100 Movies I Want to Watch in 2020 - Film 46/100I hate to be that person as I do love long films but I feel like this is slightly too much on the longer side. Tom Hanks wasn’t that engaging to be honest, and I struggle to connect with supernatural/fantasy films, especially if they’re grounded in an otherwise completely normal world. ***"

A Moment of Innocence,1996,Mohsen Makhmalbaf, ★★★★½ ," How can you explain this film to somebody? You can't, it's a film that you need to witness on your own. ***"
A Moment of Innocence,1996,Mohsen Makhmalbaf, ★★★★ ," Deconstruction as a vessel for reconciliation. The past converging with the present; reality merging with cinema, until the two become one. A pair of souls—one regretful, the other adrift—rewriting a mutual history in cathartic synthesis, discovering a connection through mutual agony. Suddenly, desire to recapture becomes a need to amend. For twenty years they set their pain down, but pain doesn’t stay in the same place; it must first be addressed and processed before it can be relinquished.The filmic rectification of a shared burden by way of A Moment of Innocence. ***"

A Moment of Innocence,1996,Mohsen Makhmalbaf, ★★★★½ ," قلبي كاد ان ينفجر مع النهاية، يالله على روعة السينما الايرانيةهنا محسن مخملباف ينتقد نفسه، يتخذ من السينما وسيلةً لزيارة ماضية عن طريق توثيق احد أخطاءة وقت الثوره في إيران حينما طعن احد رجال الأمن، الفلم ينتقل بين الواقع والتمثيل مع سرد رائع واجواء عامة بسيطة وفكرة مميزة كمضمون وتنفيذ.. تتجلى فيها براءة الإنسان, مشاعرة وغفرانة.  ***"

A Moment of Innocence,1996,Mohsen Makhmalbaf, ★★★½ ," Like a dog chasing its tail, our protagonist undertakes a futile quest to recapture a past which perpetually eludes and escapes him. The dizzying roundabout of memories and reinterpretation spins so smoothly that it looks still, and any dizziness subsides into a calm loop. ***"
A Moment of Innocence,1996,Mohsen Makhmalbaf, ★★★★½ ," Film at its most spiritual, transformative, healing, introspective and revealing. When humankind eventually dies, this movie will play during the end credits. ***"
A Moment of Innocence,1996,Mohsen Makhmalbaf, ★★★★ ," difficult in ways that are almost always disarming and lovable, i was prepared to fight this film, the film that had layers inside its layers and was doubtless as confusing as could possibly be.. but there's so much humour and heart within the madness it's difficult to even be mad that you don't know where you are. Mirhadi Tayebi has to be one of the most unique looking humans on film, man looks like a simpsons character, carrying the film forward on his giant monobrow like a majestic airship soaring through a cloudy sky ***"
A Moment of Innocence,1996,Mohsen Makhmalbaf, ★★★★★ ," Mohsen Makhmalbaf uses cinema to pinpoint the exact moment when two lives, his own and that of a stabbed ex-cop, were damaged in the name of love, and uses it to revisit that moment and offer repentance — always and again, for the same holy cause. Pretty much justifies the entire ""movie"" gambit. I must have replayed that final shot about 5 times; the full gravity of what I was seeing didn't hit me until the 6th. And then, the tears. ***"

I really just had one of the greatest cinematic experiences I have experienced.Just don’t read anything about it before you watch it. Stop reading this actually and go watch it. ***"
A Moment of Innocence,1996,Mohsen Makhmalbaf, ★★★★★ , يقول مخملباف عن الفلم: كان شبه روائي والذي استخدمته لإيصال نصيحتي إلى المجتمع. لكنني أيضًا انتقدت ذاتي الأصغر سنًا بطريقة رمزية ، حتى أنتقد ثورتنا ، حيث كان من المستحيل تقريبًا أن أنتقد الثورة بطريقة مباشرة ، حاولت أن أتجاوز قصتي الشخصية ، كي أشير إلى مشكلة هيكلية أكبر، كالعنف الملازم للثورة وأن أعرض نسخة غير عنيفة منهااذا هالفيلم مو أنقى فلم تابعته انا ما افهم ، جمالية رساله وبساطة تقديم تدّرس حقيقةرساله يهديها المخرج لنفسه في الماضي ولسان حاله يقول الأمور قد لا تحتاج الى العنف حتى تتحول للأفضل واستشعرت ان رسم بآخر الفلم الشيء اللي وده حصل لهأعجز أعجز عن وصف هالفيلم. ***
